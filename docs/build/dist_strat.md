## üèóÔ∏è **Channel-Specific Implementation**

### **1. Homebrew (Priority 1)**
**Rationale**: Healthcare developers disproportionately use macOS, Homebrew is the gold standard

```bash
# Target UX
brew tap pidgeon-health/tap
brew install pidgeon
pidgeon --version  # Works immediately
```

**Implementation**:
- Create `pidgeon-health/homebrew-tap` repository
- Auto-update formula on each release via GitHub Actions
- Support both x64 and ARM64 architectures
- Include `install.json` marker: `{"channel": "homebrew"}`

**Update Flow**: `brew update && brew upgrade pidgeon`

### **2. Direct Download (Priority 1)**
**Rationale**: Enterprise security policies often require verified direct downloads

```bash
# Target UX
curl -fsSL https://get.pidgeon.health/install.sh | sh
pidgeon update  # Self-update capability
```

**Implementation**:
- Self-contained binaries for all platforms
- `get.pidgeon.health` install script with platform detection
- SHA256 verification built-in
- Self-update mechanism with atomic replacement

**Update Flow**: `pidgeon update` (self-contained)

### **3. Linux Packages (Priority 2)**
**Rationale**: Enterprise Linux environments, package management integration

```bash
# Target UX - Debian/Ubuntu
curl -fsSL https://packages.pidgeon.health/key.asc | sudo apt-key add -
echo "deb https://packages.pidgeon.health/apt stable main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/pidgeon.list
sudo apt update && sudo apt install pidgeon

# Target UX - RHEL/Fedora
sudo dnf config-manager --add-repo https://packages.pidgeon.health/rpm
sudo dnf install pidgeon
```

**Implementation**:
- **nfpm** for .deb/.rpm generation
- **Cloudsmith** hosting (professional, audit-compliant)
- GPG repository signing for package verification
- Proper dependency management and conflicts resolution

**Update Flow**: Standard package manager updates

### **4. Windows (Priority 2)**
**Rationale**: Healthcare organizations heavily Windows-based

```powershell
# Target UX
winget install PidgeonHealth.Pidgeon
pidgeon --version
```

**Implementation**:
- Authenticode code signing for SmartScreen trust
- Auto-generated winget manifests via `wingetcreate`
- PR automation to `microsoft/winget-pkgs`
- Proper Windows installer experience

**Update Flow**: `winget upgrade pidgeon`

### **5. npm Global (Priority 3)**
**Rationale**: Node.js ecosystem integration, CI/CD pipeline adoption

```bash
# Target UX
npm install -g @pidgeon-health/pidgeon
pidgeon --version
```

**Implementation**:
- Wrapper package with platform-specific binary download
- `postinstall` script handles platform detection
- Proper Windows `.cmd` shim generation
- Scoped package for namespace control

**Update Flow**: `npm update -g @pidgeon-health/pidgeon`
