# Perspective 1: Technical Founder

*Having built and sold multiple healthcare tech companies, here's what I've learned the hard way.*

## The Architecture You Need from Day One

### What Most Founders Build (And Regret)
```csharp
// Year 1: "Just get it working"
public class RDEMessage : HL7Message {
    public PIDSegment PatientIdentification { get; set; }
    public static RDEMessage Parse(string hl7) { /* 500 lines of parsing */ }
}

// Year 3: "We need FHIR support"
public class FHIRMedicationRequest {
    // Completely different structure, can't reuse anything
}

// Year 5: "Technical debt is killing us"
// 16-20 week refactor or complete rewrite
```

### What You Should Build Instead
```csharp
// Day 1: Domain-first with adapters
namespace Segmint.Core.Domain {
    // Pure business logic, no standard-specific code
    public record Prescription(
        PatientId Patient,
        MedicationCode Drug,
        Dosage Instructions,
        PrescriberId Provider
    );
}

namespace Segmint.Core.Standards {
    // Each standard is just a serialization format
    public interface IStandardAdapter<T> {
        string Generate(T domain);
        T Parse(string message);
    }
    
    // Adding new standards is trivial
    public class HL7Adapter : IStandardAdapter<Prescription> { }
    public class FHIRAdapter : IStandardAdapter<Prescription> { }
    public class NCPDPAdapter : IStandardAdapter<Prescription> { }
}
```

## Critical Architectural Decisions

### 1. Hexagonal Architecture (Ports & Adapters)
**Why**: Your domain logic becomes immortal. Standards change, regulations change, but a prescription is always a prescription.

**Implementation**:
- Core domain has ZERO dependencies on external libraries
- All I/O through interfaces (ports)
- Infrastructure implements interfaces (adapters)

### 2. Event Sourcing for Compliance
**Why**: Healthcare = audits. You WILL need to prove what happened and when.

```csharp
public record MessageProcessed(
    DateTime Timestamp,
    string MessageId,
    string Standard,
    string Operation,
    Result Outcome,
    Dictionary<string, object> Metadata
);

// Every operation becomes replayable
_eventStore.Append(new MessageProcessed(...));
```

### 3. Plugin Architecture from Day One
**Why**: Adding HL7 v2.7 support should be a day's work, not a month's refactor.

```csharp
// New message types are plugins
services.AddPlugin<HL7v23Plugin>();
services.AddPlugin<HL7v251Plugin>();  // Added in 2 hours
services.AddPlugin<FHIRPlugin>();     // Added without touching HL7
```

### 4. Dependency Injection Everywhere
**Why**: Static classes are cancer. They metastasize through your codebase.

```csharp
// ❌ NEVER THIS
public static class WorkflowExtensions {
    public static void ValidateWorkflow(Message m) { }
}

// ✅ ALWAYS THIS
public interface IWorkflowValidator {
    ValidationResult Validate(Message m);
}
```

### 5. Result<T> Pattern (Railway-Oriented Programming)
**Why**: Exceptions for control flow will haunt you at 3am when production is down.

```csharp
public Result<Message> ProcessMessage(string input)
    => Parse(input)
        .Bind(Validate)
        .Bind(Transform)
        .Bind(Send);
        
// Errors handled elegantly, no try-catch nightmare
```

### 6. CQRS Where It Matters
**Why**: Reading for validation has different needs than writing for generation.

```csharp
// Commands change state
public record GenerateMessage(Patient Patient, MessageType Type) : ICommand;

// Queries don't
public record GetMessageHistory(PatientId Id) : IQuery<List<Message>>;
```

## What This Architecture Enables

### Adding New Standards: 2 Days vs 2 Months
With proper architecture:
1. Create new adapter implementing IStandardAdapter
2. Register in DI container
3. Done

Without it:
1. Refactor core to abstract concepts
2. Break existing functionality
3. Fix regression bugs for weeks
4. Still coupled and fragile

### Testing: Minutes vs Hours
- Every component independently testable
- Mock any dependency
- Parallel test execution
- 90%+ code coverage achievable

### Scaling: Horizontal vs Vertical
- Stateless services scale horizontally
- Event sourcing enables replay and recovery
- Plugin architecture allows feature flags
- Different customers, different features

## Hard-Learned Lessons

### "We'll Refactor Later" = Technical Bankruptcy
I've seen three companies fail because of this. The refactor never comes. New features get prioritized. Technical debt compounds. Eventually, adding a simple field takes weeks.

### Your First 100 Lines Determine Your Next 100,000
The patterns you establish early become religious doctrine. Choose wisely:
- If you start with static classes, everything becomes static
- If you start with exceptions, error handling becomes chaotic
- If you start with tight coupling, everything becomes spaghetti

### Open Source Core is a Superpower
My previous company tried to keep everything proprietary. Competitors with open cores:
- Got 10x more users (free marketing)
- Got bug reports and fixes for free
- Built ecosystem of extensions
- Still monetized better (enterprises pay for support)

### AI Changes Everything (If You Let It)
Don't bolt on AI as an afterthought. Design for it:
- Streaming responses for LLM integration
- Token tracking from day one
- Fallback paths for when AI fails
- Cost allocation per customer

## The Founder's Checklist

Before writing a single line of code, ensure:

- [ ] Domain models defined (no standard-specific fields)
- [ ] Plugin architecture designed (how will you add standards?)
- [ ] DI container selected (Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection)
- [ ] Event store planned (even if just to files initially)
- [ ] Result<T> pattern adopted (no exceptions for control)
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline ready (deploy from day one)
- [ ] Licensing strategy clear (MPL 2.0 for core)
- [ ] Cost model validated (especially AI costs)

## The Bottom Line

I sold my last company for $47M. It took 7 years. If I had started with this architecture, it would have taken 4 years and sold for $100M+. The difference? We spent 40% of our time fighting technical debt instead of building features.

With Segmint, you have the chance to do it right from day one. The architecture I'm recommending isn't theoretical - it's battle-tested across multiple successful exits.

**Remember**: You're not building an HL7 generator. You're building a healthcare data platform that happens to support HL7 (and FHIR, and NCPDP, and whatever comes next).

Build for the platform you'll need in 5 years, not the MVP you need next month. The extra 2 weeks of setup will save you 2 years of refactoring.

*Better to own 17% of a $100M platform than 100% of a $1M tool that can't scale.*
