#### **Sample Message Analysis**
```sql  
-- Message analysis workflow
AnalysisJobs (id, status, vendor, standard, message_type, sample_count, started_at, completed_at)
MessageSamples (id, job_id, message_content, parsed_segments, analysis_results)
InferredPatterns (id, job_id, pattern_type, pattern_data, confidence, frequency)

-- Queries needed:
-- Bulk insert thousands of sample messages
-- Pattern extraction and statistical analysis
-- Incremental analysis as new samples added
```

**Storage Implications:**
- **Large text fields**: Full HL7/FHIR/NCPDP message content

## üìã **Decision Framework**

### **Key Questions to Resolve:**

1. **Start Simple vs Future-Proof**: 
   - Begin with PostgreSQL-only architecture for simplicity?
   - Or implement multi-database architecture from the start?

2. **Storage Cost Management**:
   - How much message sample data should we retain?
   - What data retention policies align with subscription tiers?

3. **Multi-Tenancy Approach**:
   - Single database with row-level security?
   - Or separate databases per large enterprise customer?

4. **Analytics Requirements**:
   - Real-time analytics necessary, or batch processing acceptable?
   - What level of cross-customer analytics do we need?

### **Recommended Decision Path:**

1. **Phase 1**: Start with file-based storage (no database) to validate configuration intelligence
2. **Phase 2**: Add PostgreSQL-only architecture for Professional/Team tiers
3. **Phase 3**: Evaluate adding specialized databases (TimescaleDB, Redis) based on actual usage patterns
4. **Phase 4**: Scale to multi-database architecture only when performance/features demand it

This approach balances architectural soundness with practical business constraints while maintaining flexibility for future scaling.
