## [0.1.0] - 2024-12-XX (Target)

### Foundation Release

#### Added
- **Core Architecture**
  - HL7Field abstract base class with validation framework
  - HL7Segment base class with field management
  - HL7Message base class with segment orchestration
  - Mirrors existing pharmacy software C++ architecture

- **Field Type System**
  - Primitive types: ST, ID, IS, NM, SI, DT, TS, TX, FT
  - Composite types: CE, XPN, XCN, XAD, XTN, CX, HD, PL, TQ, CQ, EI, CM
  - Full HL7 v2.3 compliance with character escaping
  - Type-specific validation and encoding/decoding

- **Configuration Analysis Framework** ðŸš€
  - Message analyzer for inferring HL7 specifications from raw messages
  - Schema inferencer for automatic configuration generation
  - Configuration generator with JSON/YAML export
  - Lockable/unlockable configuration management system
  - Version control and change tracking capabilities

- **Project Infrastructure**
  - Modern Python packaging with pyproject.toml
  - Comprehensive documentation structure
  - MIT license with healthcare-specific considerations
  - Git repository with proper configuration

#### Technical Details
- **Language**: Python 3.8+
- **Dependencies**: LangChain, Pydantic, Click, FastAPI
- **Architecture**: Modular design mirroring pharmacy software patterns
- **HL7 Version**: Strict v2.3 compliance (MSH-12 = "2.3")

#### Key Innovation: Configuration Revolution
This release introduces a revolutionary approach to HL7 interface management:

**Before**: Manual analysis of raw HL7 â†’ Manual field mapping â†’ Manual documentation â†’ Manual change tracking

**After**: Upload de-identified HL7 â†’ Automatic configuration generation â†’ Version-controlled configs â†’ Automatic change detection

This solves the major operational challenge of maintaining HL7 interfaces across multiple vendors where schema changes are difficult to detect and track.

### Coming Next (v0.2.0)
- Standard HL7 segment implementations (MSH, PID, EVN, ORC, RXE, etc.)
- Custom Z-segment classes for pharmacy workflows
- Message type classes (RDE, RDS, ADT, ORM, ACK)
- HL7 message encoding/decoding with proper formatting

## Development Notes

### Key Architectural Decisions

#### 2024-12-11: Configuration Inference Strategy
**Problem**: Healthcare organizations struggle with manual HL7 schema mapping and vendor change tracking across massive vendor bases.

**Solution**: Implemented message analysis engine that can:
- Parse raw HL7 messages (PHI removed) to infer specifications
- Automatically generate vendor configurations
- Track schema changes over time with diff capabilities
- Provide lockable/unlockable configuration management

**Impact**: This addresses a critical operational pain point where teams currently don't track vendor changes because the manual effort is too high.

#### 2024-12-11: Pharmacy Software Architecture Mirroring
**Decision**: Mirror existing C++ pharmacy software architecture (THL7Field â†’ HL7Field, etc.)

**Rationale**: Ensures generated messages are fully compatible with existing pharmacy software interfaces without requiring changes to production systems.

#### 2024-12-11: HL7 v2.3 Strict Compliance
**Decision**: Maintain strict HL7 v2.3 compliance with MSH-12 always set to "2.3"

**Rationale**: Existing pharmacy software expects v2.3 format. Newer HL7 versions would require interface modifications.

### Lessons Learned

#### Configuration Management is Critical
The conversation revealed that configuration management and vendor change tracking is a much bigger operational problem than initially anticipated. The ability to automatically infer configurations from messages could be more valuable than the message generation itself.

#### Maintainability Focus
Emphasis on creating systems that can be maintained by others after the original developer moves on. This drove decisions around:
- Clear documentation
- Modular architecture
- Configuration-driven design
- Automated processes

#### Real-World Problem Solving
Focus on solving actual operational challenges rather than just technical implementation:
- Manual effort reduction
- Error prevention
- Team enablement
- Process automation
