# Pidgeon Business Vision & Strategic Positioning

## vision statement

**UPDATED STRATEGY (Sept 14, 2025)**: Pidgeon adopts a two-product gateway approach to maximize market penetration and revenue potential.

**Product 1 - Pidgeon Testing Suite**: Best-in-class healthcare message testing and validation platform  
**Product 2 - Pidgeon Observability Platform**: The **indispensable observability and intelligence layer** for healthcare interfaces

Where traditional engines like Mirth, Cloverleaf, or Rhapsody move messages, Pidgeon will deliver **continuous visibility, assurance, and actionable insight** into those flows. Our goal is to make Pidgeon as essential to interface infrastructure as SIEMs are to cybersecurity.

By combining testing, validation, observability, and analytics in a single platform, Pidgeon will:

* Ensure messages flow safely, reliably, and in compliance.
* Provide developers and consultants with fast feedback during testing and go-live.
* Deliver IT leaders and clinicians real-time dashboards and analytics from de-identified message content.
* Establish itself as a permanent part of healthcare’s data exchange topology.

## north star

**“Every healthcare interface, everywhere, monitored and understood by Pidgeon.”**

We will achieve this by:

1. **Augmenting engines, not replacing them** — providing observability, validation, and analytics across any integration stack.
2. **Zero-PHI commitment** — de-identify in real time so telemetry and analytics are always safe and compliant.
3. **Lifecycle coverage** — testing and simulating pre-go-live; monitoring, alerting, and analyzing in production.
4. **Open adoption** — a powerful free core (CLI + agent) to drive community and market penetration.
5. **Premium enterprise features** — advanced analytics, AI insights, governance, and cloud hosting for revenue and sustainability.

## positioning summary

Pidgeon is the **healthcare integration intelligence platform**. Interface engines handle connectivity; Pidgeon ensures those connections are **reliable, observable, and intelligible**. By combining dev/test productivity with live observability and executive-level intelligence, we position Pidgeon as:

* The everyday tool developers and consultants won’t work without.
* The safety net and assurance layer for IT directors.
* The analytics and compliance engine for executives.

With open-core adoption and enterprise-grade upsells, Pidgeon will carve out the category of **“healthcare interface observability and intelligence”** and establish itself as a permanent fixture in healthcare data infrastructure.
