# Pidgeon One-Page Pitch

## the problem

Healthcare data exchange runs on complex HL7, FHIR, and NCPDP interfaces. Engines like Mirth and Cloverleaf move the data, but teams lack **visibility, assurance, and intelligence**:

* Failures are often only noticed when hospitals complain.
* Debugging requires manual log dives.
* No clear way to turn message flows into operational or clinical insights.

## the solution

**UPDATED STRATEGY (Sept 14, 2025)**: Pidgeon delivers a two-product solution:

**Pidgeon Testing Suite**: Healthcare message testing and validation platform (immediate market entry)
**Pidgeon Observability Platform**: Healthcare interface observability and intelligence platform (enterprise expansion)

* **Testing & validation**: Generate synthetic HL7/FHIR data, validate against specs, infer vendor quirks.
* **Observability**: Monitor live interfaces, track errors, latency, and drift; proactive alerts prevent downtime.
* **Analytics**: De-identify traffic and transform it into dashboards, trends, and compliance reports.
* **Intelligence**: AI-driven anomaly detection, natural-language summaries, and benchmarking across systems.

## why now

* Healthcare is mandating interoperability (FHIR APIs, TEFCA).
* Integration teams are overwhelmed with interfaces and errors.
* Observability platforms (Datadog, Splunk) dominate IT—but **nothing like this exists for HL7/FHIR messaging**.

## product roadmap

* **Phase 1:** Mirth monitoring plugin, alerts, basic dashboards.
* **Phase 2:** Data lake + prebuilt dashboards, AI insights.
* **Phase 3:** Multi-engine + API/FHIR support, unified view.
* **Phase 4:** Enterprise governance, SaaS/hybrid scale, marketplace.

## business model

* **Free core (open-core):** CLI + agent for adoption.
* **Professional:** advanced dashboards, AI triage, vendor packs.
* **Enterprise:** multi-engine support, SSO, audit, compliance, managed cloud.
* **Add-ons:** migration kits, compliance packs, marketplace blueprints.

## positioning

Engines **move** messages. **Pidgeon makes them observable and intelligible.**

We are the **permanent assurance and analytics layer** in healthcare integration. Developers, IT directors, and executives alike will rely on Pidgeon for:

* Faster testing and go-lives.
* Fewer outages and faster troubleshooting.
* Trusted analytics from message flows without PHI risk.

**Tagline:** *Pidgeon — Every healthcare interface, observable and understood.*
