Pidgeon Conservative Pro Forma Estimates

framing assumptions (UPDATED Sept 14, 2025)
	•	Pidgeon adopts two-product strategy: Testing Suite + Observability Platform.
	•	Testing Suite: open-core with Pro ($29/month) and Enterprise tiers.
	•	Observability Platform: Enterprise SaaS ($5k–50k/year).
	•	Target market: Testing (developers, consultants) → Observability (hospital IT operations).
	•	Market behavior: Testing Suite builds user base, natural progression to Observability Platform.

⸻

adoption funnel (conservative)
	•	Year 1: 500–1,000 free users (mainly developers on Mirth). 5% convert → 25–50 Pro seats.
	•	Year 2: 2,000–3,000 free users as coverage expands (Rhapsody/Cloverleaf connectors). 7% convert → 140–200 Pro seats + 5 small enterprise contracts.
	•	Year 3: 5,000–7,000 free users across engines + APIs. 8–10% convert → 400–700 Pro seats + 20 enterprise accounts.

⸻

revenue scenarios (usd)

Professional (individual/seat based):
	•	Year 1: 50 users × $30/mo ≈ $18k ARR.
	•	Year 2: 200 users × $30/mo ≈ $72k ARR.
	•	Year 3: 600 users × $30/mo ≈ $216k ARR.

Enterprise (contracts):
	•	Year 1: 0–1 pilot enterprise ($10k).
	•	Year 2: 5 contracts × avg $15k ≈ $75k ARR.
	•	Year 3: 20 contracts × avg $25k ≈ $500k ARR.

Total Revenue:
	•	Year 1: ~$20–30k.
	•	Year 2: ~$150k.
	•	Year 3: ~$700k.

⸻

cost structure (lean, solo-founder + gradual scaling)
	•	Year 1: $50–75k (dev time, cloud infra, compliance, modest marketing).
	•	Year 2: $150–200k (add 1–2 engineers, support, security certifications).
	•	Year 3: $400–500k (team of 4–6, enterprise sales effort, compliance audits, SOC2/HITRUST).

EBITDA (conservative):
	•	Year 1: negative (investment year).
	•	Year 2: near break-even.
	•	Year 3: modest profit margin (~20–30%) possible if growth targets are met.

⸻

valuation positioning
	•	Comparable SaaS (observability/health IT niche) often trade at 5–8× ARR.
	•	By Year 3, at ~$700k ARR, conservative valuation ~$3–5M.
	•	Upside if traction is stronger (enterprise adoption grows faster, e.g. 50 accounts by Year 3) could push ARR past $1.5M and valuations into $8–12M range.

⸻

conservative takeaways
	1.	Floor viability: Even if adoption grows slowly, Pidgeon could sustain a small but profitable niche business (~$200–300k ARR by Year 3).
	2.	Career leverage: The product and traction itself are career-capital assets (supports $150k+ senior roles).
	3.	Upside scenarios: Enterprise adoption is the real growth driver; each $25–50k contract adds material ARR quickly.
	4.	Risk factors: Low conversion (devs stick with free), slow enterprise sales cycles, competition adding observability features.

⸻

strategy implication

Pidgeon should:
	•	Use free CLI/agent to maximize adoption and build a funnel.
	•	Target consultancies and mid-size hospitals early for faster enterprise wins.
	•	Invest in compliance (SOC2/HITRUST) by Year 2 to unlock larger contracts.
	•	Position as mission-critical, recurring-value observability, not just a testing tool — this drives enterprise willingness to pay recurring fees.

Conservatively, Pidgeon can reach ~$700k ARR in 3 years with lean operations. Upside could exceed $1M ARR if observability adoption accelerates.
