Pidgeon Strategic Development Plan: Deep Observability & Embedded Value

Vision: Next-Wave Healthcare Messaging Platform

Goal: Evolve Pidgeon from a testing/validation tool into a deep observability platform that works alongside interface engines to provide continuous monitoring, analytics, and intelligence on message flows. By doing so, Pidgeon becomes an indispensable, embedded part of the healthcare interface topology for institutions. This aligns with Pidgeon’s mission of zero-PHI risk integration and fast troubleshooting, now extended into production environments ￼. We aim to deliver the “next wave” of value after traditional interface engines – much like how SIEM systems augment basic logging by aggregating and analyzing data for actionable insights ￼ ￼. In practice, this means:
	•	Deeper Observability: Real-time visibility into message traffic (throughput, errors, latency) across interfaces, with proactive alerts for issues (e.g. stuck queues, failed messages).
	•	Embedded Analytics: Using de-identified message content to generate rich reports and business intelligence for healthcare operations. Pidgeon will act as a plug-and-play analytics layer on the message stream, analogous to how SIEMs normalize and analyze security logs for threats ￼. Here, the focus is on clinical and operational patterns (e.g. trend of lab orders, spikes in certain ADT events) that interface engines alone do not surface.
	•	Permanent Topology Component: By delivering continuous value (operational telemetry and strategic insights) without adding PHI risk, Pidgeon becomes a standard part of interface deployments. Over time, it should be as expected in a hospital’s integration stack as the interface engine itself – ensuring any new or existing interface routes through Pidgeon’s monitoring for quality and intelligence.

Strategic Fit: This direction builds on Pidgeon’s core strengths (healthcare messaging expertise, vendor pattern knowledge, PHI de-identification) and extends them. Pidgeon already differentiates itself by focusing on testing/validation rather than being a live engine ￼; observability features reinforce this complementary role. We will not replace interface engines, but augment them – much like New Relic or Datadog augment application servers. In doing so, we create a defensible niche and deepen our integration with customer workflows, from development (test data generation) to production (monitoring and analytics).

Market Landscape & Inspiration

Current State in Healthcare Integration: Most interface engines (Mirth, Rhapsody, Cloverleaf, etc.) offer only basic monitoring consoles. Teams often find out about interface issues after the fact – for example, a hospital may report they haven’t received messages for days, prompting engineers to manually check and discover a queue buildup or error backlog ￼ ￼. Proactive alerting and historical visibility are limited out-of-the-box. As a result, savvy teams have improvised solutions using general observability tools: one common approach is calling Mirth’s APIs for message stats and feeding that into Slack alerts or Grafana dashboards ￼ ￼. This DIY monitoring indicates a real need but also shows the lack of a purpose-built solution. It’s time-consuming, error-prone (scripts can break with credential or API changes ￼), and often doesn’t capture message content for deeper insights.

Proven Models in Other Domains: In broader IT, modern observability and SIEM platforms have become essential by aggregating telemetry from multiple systems and providing intelligent analysis ￼. For example, SIEMs pull together logs from servers, networks, and apps into one interface, normalize them, and detect patterns or anomalies in real-time ￼ ￼. They demonstrate that centralizing data + smart analytics = high operational value. We see an analogous opportunity in healthcare integration: HL7/FHIR messages are rich in data and patterns, but currently reside in disparate engine logs. A system that unifies these streams, parses them into a common structure, and analyzes them can deliver insights previously inaccessible. Industry interest in HL7 analytics is growing – e.g. mining HL7 messages for trends like disease outbreak spikes or ED utilization is touted as a benefit ￼. Some vendors (e.g. Lifepoint Informatics) highlight how HL7 message data can feed real-time dashboards and decision support if properly extracted ￼. However, few turnkey products exist to do this; it often requires custom data warehouse projects.

Competitive Landscape: No major player today offers a “Splunk for HL7 interfaces” at scale – this is a gap Pidgeon can fill. Interface engine vendors mostly focus on message routing and basic monitoring; their value proposition isn’t analytics or cross-vendor intelligence. By contrast, Pidgeon’s planned vendor pattern library and AI assistants already inch toward leveraging aggregate knowledge ￼ ￼. Extending into observability solidifies a new category: the healthcare integration intelligence platform. Our competitive advantage will be: domain-specific insight (healthcare standards, PHI handling) that generic monitoring tools lack, and neutrality across different interface engines (we sit on top of any engine, providing a unified layer). This positions Pidgeon as the platform delivering “native value after interface engines,” i.e., once the pipes are in place, Pidgeon maximizes their effectiveness.

Finally, embracing proven open-source or open-core strategies from the DevOps world (Prometheus/Grafana, Elastic Stack, etc.) can speed our adoption. Those tools have shown that giving the community powerful free components can establish de-facto standards, which companies then monetize with enterprise features or cloud services. We will take inspiration from these models in our go-to-market, as detailed below.

Phase 1: Observability MVP with Mirth Connect (Start with Mirth, then expand)

The first step is delivering immediate value for the most widely-used engine, Mirth Connect. Mirth (NextGen Connect) is open-source and prevalent, making it an ideal starting point to prove out our observability concept.

Key Features (MVP for Mirth):
	•	Mirth Monitoring Agent/Plugin: Develop a lightweight module that interfaces with Mirth to extract real-time metrics and message events. This could leverage Mirth’s REST APIs (e.g. /api/channels/statistics for throughput/queue counts) ￼ or possibly a custom extension deployed in Mirth. The agent will gather: number of messages processed, queued, errors per channel, processing time, etc., at frequent intervals.
	•	Proactive Alerts: Allow users to set thresholds or auto-detect anomalies in metrics. For example, if error counts spike or messages stop flowing in a normally active channel, trigger an alert (email, Slack, etc.). This addresses the current pain where teams only discover issues after hospitals complain ￼. Instead, Pidgeon will notify them within minutes of a problem, preventing prolonged outages.
	•	Dashboard & Trends: Provide a simple web dashboard (or integrate with existing ones like Grafana via an exporter) to visualize key stats over time – e.g. messages per hour, error rate trends, queue length. Engineers have resorted to Grafana for trend visibility ￼; our solution should offer this out-of-the-box. Even a basic dashboard in the Pidgeon app showing each interface’s status (green/yellow/red) with drill-down charts adds significant value.
	•	PHI-Safe Message Logging: Enable capture of message samples for deeper analysis, but with automated de-identification. Using Pidgeon’s on-prem de-id capabilities ￼, the agent can strip or tokenize patient identifiers in real-time as messages pass through. This yields a log of content that’s safe to store and analyze centrally. (We’ll initially do this for a subset of traffic or on-demand, to manage performance and storage.)
	•	Integration with Testing Tools: As a stretch goal, the agent can tag or forward any failed messages or errors to the Pidgeon testing environment. For instance, if a message fails in production, it could be sent (post-deidentification) to Pidgeon’s validation engine to automatically diagnose the issue or reproduce it in a test scenario. This creates a seamless loop: production issues generate test cases, and our validation AI suggests fixes – drastically reducing troubleshooting time.

Why Mirth First: Mirth’s ubiquity and openness mean a large initial user base and easier development (APIs are accessible, community exists). Success here provides a template for other engines. Mirth is often used by smaller hospitals and startups too, who would readily try a free observability add-on. Proving value with Mirth gives us case studies and credibility to approach larger, proprietary engine users later. Additionally, Mirth has a plugin ecosystem – we might build a Pidgeon Connector channel that can be imported into Mirth, making installation straightforward.

Outcome of Phase 1: We establish Pidgeon as a must-have companion to Mirth for any serious deployment. The goal is that after seeing Pidgeon catch a stuck interface or provide a convenient dashboard, teams will not want to run Mirth without Pidgeon monitoring enabled. Even in this initial form, Pidgeon should demonstrate reduced downtime (via early alerts) and time saved in detecting/resolving issues. This sets the stage for broader adoption and justifies expanding to more engines. Importantly, Phase 1 also lets us gather real-world data (de-identified) about message flows, which will feed into the next phase of value-add analytics.

Phase 2: Rich Reporting & Intelligence on Message Data

With the observability pipeline in place (at least for Mirth, and later others), Phase 2 focuses on leveraging the content of messages and the accumulated data for deeper insights – the “BI” side mentioned in our vision. This is where Pidgeon moves beyond pure monitoring into analytics and intelligence akin to a healthcare-specific SIEM.

Key Enhancements:
	•	De-Identified Data Lake: Expand our data collection to store historical, de-identified message content in a structured form. For example, push key fields of HL7 messages (message type, event, timestamps, codes, etc.) into a time-series database or search index. This is analogous to how SIEMs normalize diverse logs into a common schema for analysis ￼. Here, we normalize HL7, FHIR, etc., into queryable datasets. We ensure no direct patient identifiers are stored (using our deterministic ID remapping and date shifting to preserve relational integrity without PHI ￼). This forms the foundation for analytics.
	•	Out-of-the-Box Dashboards: Provide pre-built dashboards and reports that turn message data into actionable information for different stakeholders:
	•	Interface Operations: e.g. “Top 10 interfaces by error rate,” “Throughput over last 24h vs baseline,” or a timeline of message latency to spot slowdowns.
	•	Clinical/Business Metrics: e.g. “Admissions per day” (from ADT messages), “Lab orders volume by category” (from ORM/ORU), or trends in certain procedure codes. These leverage message content for hospital BI. Notably, HL7 analytics can reveal spikes in diseases or utilization if mined properly ￼. Pidgeon could, for instance, detect an unusual increase in lab test orders for a particular virus and alert epidemiology staff – turning interface data into public health insight. Another example is using ADT messages to inform staffing (monitoring how many ED arrivals each hour) ￼.
	•	Compliance and Auditing: e.g. tracking that messages are flowing securely (no unencrypted channels), or generating reports of message volumes for regulatory reporting. We might cross-reference logs with compliance requirements (similar to how SIEMs generate audit trails ￼; in healthcare, think HIPAA interface audit reports).
	•	Interactive Query & Search: Allow users (likely advanced, e.g. analysts or interface engineers) to query the stored message data. This could be a simple query builder or even a SQL/Elasticsearch interface for complex searches (e.g. “find all messages from system X that contain segment ERR within last 7 days”). This turns Pidgeon into an interface message datastore that was not available before. Organizations can retrieve data without building their own data warehouse for HL7.
	•	Anomaly Detection & AI Insights: Build on our AI expertise to analyze patterns in the message data:
	•	Use anomaly detection to flag unusual patterns (e.g. sudden drop to zero in a usually steady feed, or content anomalies like a field that’s usually numeric showing non-numeric frequently – possibly indicating an upstream system issue).
	•	Leverage vendor pattern profiles: since Pidgeon’s core already infers vendor message patterns ￼, it can monitor live data for deviations from the known profile (alerting if a vendor perhaps changed their format unexpectedly – a common cause of interface failure).
	•	Offer natural language explanations or summaries: e.g. “This week’s HL7 traffic increased 20% over last – mostly due to ORU messages from LabCorp interface” – an AI-generated insight that executives could consume.
	•	Provide troubleshooting guidance: if an alert fires (e.g. high error rate on an interface), Pidgeon’s AI could automatically analyze sample errors and suggest probable causes (combining our validation engine and knowledge base). This is akin to a SIEM’s intelligent alerting, repurposed for integration errors instead of security threats.

Value Proposition: In this phase, Pidgeon moves from operational tool to strategic asset. By treating HL7/FHIR messages as a source of business intelligence, we deliver value to new personas: department heads, analysts, CIOs – not just interface developers. For example, quick access to “HL7 analytics” can save enormous effort; Lifepoint notes that mining HL7 can produce valuable dashboards without a heavy data modeling project ￼ ￼. Pidgeon will automate that extraction and insight generation. Because all data is de-identified and aggregated, hospitals can safely use it for internal analysis or even cross-institution comparisons (if we enable benchmarking in future).

Additionally, these analytics further entrench Pidgeon in the ecosystem. Once the platform is the repository of an organization’s interface data and knowledge, it becomes as hard to rip out as an EMR reporting database or a Splunk deployment – it’s holding critical historical data and dashboards that stakeholders rely on. This permanence is exactly our goal in becoming “more-or-less permanent” in the interface topology.

Phase 3: Multi-Engine Support & Ecosystem Expansion

With a solid solution proven on Mirth, the next step is to sequentially expand Pidgeon’s observability to all major interface engines and integration modalities. Ultimately, any healthcare data interchange – whether via legacy HL7 engines or modern API hubs – should feed into Pidgeon’s unified monitoring layer. We will prioritize based on market share and technical feasibility:
	•	Next Targets (Interface Engines): likely candidates are NextGen Connect (Mirth) enterprise version (minimal tweaks from Phase 1), Lyniate Rhapsody, Infor Cloverleaf, and Epic Bridges. Each requires a tailored approach:
	•	Rhapsody: It offers APIs and possibly an embedded database for message metadata. We could create a Rhapsody plugin or use its existing monitoring hooks to export data. Collaborating with Lyniate or using customer input will help us map this out.
	•	Cloverleaf: Might require reading SMAT log files or using Cloverleaf’s built-in SMAT database to pull message logs. Possibly an agent that reads those periodically and applies our de-id + upload routine.
	•	Epic Bridges: Being part of the Epic ecosystem, direct integration is harder. But we might allow Bridges to send copies of messages to an external system. If not, focusing on the outward interfaces from Epic (which often go through an engine like InterSystems IRIS) could be the way.
	•	Others: Integration engines like Corepoint, Iguana, InterSystems IRIS, and emerging cloud interface services can be added as we grow. We may provide an SDK for others to develop connectors as well.
	•	Integration with API-based Platforms: As FHIR and API-based exchange grows, Pidgeon should monitor those too. For example, Redox or Datica are integration-as-a-service platforms; we can consume their logs or webhook notifications. Also, if hospitals use custom API gateways for FHIR (e.g. through AWS API Gateway or Mulesoft), Pidgeon’s agent could tap into those request logs. By supporting both HL7 and API traffic, we position ourselves as the observability layer for hybrid interoperability environments (legacy and modern).
	•	Unified View and Control: As we add multiple sources, Pidgeon will evolve the dashboard to a unified command center. A hospital that has Mirth in one department and Rhapsody in another, plus some FHIR APIs, should see all their interfaces’ health in one place. This is a strong selling point: instead of siloed monitors per engine, one ring to rule them all. Pidgeon can correlate across engines too (e.g. if an ADT flows from Mirth to Rhapsody, we could trace it through if we assign a common ID or timestamp correlation – introducing traceability across systems). Enabling such end-to-end tracing in healthcare messaging could be revolutionary, akin to distributed tracing in microservices, and technologically it’s feasible with standards like OpenTelemetry adapted to HL7/FHIR.
	•	Deployment Options at Scale: To truly embed in varied institutions, we must offer flexibility in how Pidgeon Observability is deployed. We plan to offer all practical options over time:
	•	On-Premises: Many hospitals will prefer a local deployment for observability (especially if they don’t want any data leaving their network). Pidgeon’s core being light (and possibly open-source) facilitates this. We might package a local server or even allow running entirely within existing infrastructure (e.g. a Docker container alongside the engine).
	•	Cloud (SaaS): For organizations comfortable with cloud and wanting ease of management, a Pidgeon cloud service can receive de-identified telemetry from on-site agents and host the dashboards. This model resembles Datadog or Splunk Cloud – minimal onsite footprint, heavy lifting in our cloud. De-identification at source ensures we handle no PHI, easing compliance. We’ll likely start with on-prem (to alleviate privacy/security concerns during early adoption) and introduce a SaaS option once we’ve proven value and trust.
	•	Hybrid: Some large enterprises might choose to keep raw data in-house but use our cloud for meta-analysis. For instance, an agent could compute metrics locally and only send aggregate stats to cloud (no message content). We can accommodate these preferences to not exclude potential customers.

Sequential Expansion: We recommend starting with a focus on one additional engine at a time, using design partners for each. For example, find a customer with Rhapsody willing to pilot Pidgeon; build that connector and ensure it meets their needs, then move to the next. Each expansion broadens our market. By the end of this phase, Pidgeon should cover the “multiple down the road” – i.e. multiple engines and integration types – making it a vendor-neutral standard. This breadth is important for marketing: we can position Pidgeon as the platform that works with “whatever you have.”

Phase 4: Open-Core Strategy & Business Model

A crucial aspect of this plan is how to balance widespread adoption with monetization, especially considering the question of open-sourcing the observability components. Pidgeon’s current strategy already leans toward an open-core model: the CLI and core features are free to drive adoption, with Professional/Enterprise tiers adding value on top ￼. We should extend this philosophy to our new observability offerings, with careful consideration of pros and cons:
	•	Open Core Observability – Pros: Opening up the core monitoring/agent code (e.g. the Mirth plugin, data schema, basic dashboard) can significantly accelerate adoption. Hospitals and vendors are more likely to trust and embed an open-source tool – especially one dealing with sensitive data – because they can inspect and even contribute to it. It lowers barriers to trial; a developer can install a free Pidgeon monitoring agent today without procurement, just as they might install a free Prometheus exporter. This could lead to Pidgeon becoming the default monitoring layer shipped with interface engines or recommended by the community. An active open-source community could contribute connectors for niche systems, improving coverage. Moreover, being open-source aligns with our Year 1 success metric of building a community around the core ￼. If we achieve “de facto” standard status in interface observability, the commercial opportunities (support, enterprise features, cloud hosting) naturally follow. This model mirrors companies like Grafana (open dashboards, paid enterprise features) or Elastic (open engine, paid cloud features). It also aligns with our “free core” adoption strategy where free users feed our growth funnel ￼ ￼.
	•	Open Core Observability – Cons: The primary risk is monetization. If we open too much core functionality, users might get sufficient value without ever upgrading. We must design clear upgrade triggers ￼. For example, basic monitoring and logging could be free, but advanced analytics (like cross-site comparisons, AI anomaly detection, long-term data retention, team collaboration features) would be paid. Another risk is competitors using our open-source components – however, our advantage lies in domain expertise and continuous innovation (and any competitor would face the same trust-building we’ve done). There’s also the risk of support burden if many free users need help; we can mitigate with community forums and by funneling enterprise users to paid support. From a financial perspective, we should model that a fraction of users converting can sustain us – this depends on delivering must-have premium features (we believe things like multi-engine centralized management, AI insights, and enterprise integrations will serve that role).
	•	Premium/Enterprise Features: To ensure a sustainable business, we will identify features that remain paid-only. Some likely candidates:
	•	Enterprise Integrations & Governance: e.g. integration with hospital SIEM or ITSM tools, SSO/LDAP for the observability dashboard, role-based access and audit logs of who viewed what (important for HIPAA compliance in monitoring tools). These align with our planned Enterprise tier features ￼ and would be valuable to larger orgs.
	•	High-Scale Cloud Analytics: Free users might be limited in how much data is retained or how many interfaces are monitored. Enterprise could get unlimited retention or support for hundreds of interfaces with our scaling and performance guarantees. Essentially, cloud hosting itself can be a paid offering – similar to how open-source Prometheus is free, but managed Prometheus at scale (with long-term storage) is a paid service.
	•	AI and Advanced Reporting: The more sophisticated features (AI-driven anomaly detection, NLP summaries, custom report builders) can be reserved for Professional/Enterprise tiers. These features provide clear ROI (e.g. catching an interface outage that saves significant downtime cost, or insights that optimize operations), making them justifiable upsells.
	•	CLI/Automation Gateways: If we develop command-line or API tools to interface with the monitoring data (for CI/CD integration, automated testing triggers, etc.), we could choose to make those enterprise-only as a way to monetize power users. However, this needs careful thought, as our CLI for testing is free – perhaps monitoring CLI could be free too, but an orchestrator that ties everything together could be paid.
	•	Fallback Option: If after evaluation the fully open approach is deemed too risky revenue-wise, we can adopt a more conservative model: keep the core observability closed-source (or source-available but not open license) for paying users only, at least initially. We might still offer a free community edition (binary or limited-feature) to drive adoption without exposing all source. This is analogous to how some companies distribute a free tier that’s feature-limited, and an enterprise tier with full features. The downside is slower community growth and potential users turned off by lack of transparency. Given that we are “already going open for testing” per our strategy, leaning into open core seems natural, but it’s wise to have this fallback. We can also choose a hybrid: for instance, open-source the engine plugins (since those interact within third-party systems and benefit from community scrutiny), but keep the central dashboard code proprietary. That way, we get adoption via open connectors, while the value-add analysis platform is commercial.

Recommendation: Begin with an open-core approach for observability MVP (Phase 1). For example, release the Mirth monitoring plugin as an open GitHub project – this encourages Mirth’s community to use and improve it. Simultaneously, include basic UI in the main Pidgeon app (which could also be open if the whole core is open source as planned ￼). As we add premium features in Phase 2 and Phase 3, clearly delineate them as paid tier. We will monitor conversion rates carefully (one of our risk mitigations is ensuring free tier doesn’t cannibalize paid ￼). The upside of broad adoption outweighs the risk at this stage: being first to claim this space is crucial, and open-core will accelerate that landgrab. We’ll revisit the strategy if we find enterprise conversions too low, but our stage-gate criteria already include checking that free → paid conversion is healthy ￼.

Long-Term: Indispensable Integration Infrastructure & Moat

By executing the above phases, Pidgeon will transform into a platform that is deeply woven into both the development and operations of healthcare interfaces. Our long-term vision sees Pidgeon achieving the following:
	•	Standard for Interface Observability: Pidgeon’s agents or connectors become a default component whenever a new interface is set up. Much like a new microservice today often includes an OpenTelemetry library for tracing, a new HL7 feed or FHIR endpoint tomorrow will include Pidgeon monitoring by default. We will pursue partnerships with interface engine vendors (e.g. bundle Pidgeon in Mirth or offer it as a recommended add-on) once we’ve proven value. If we succeed, even competitors will find it hard to displace Pidgeon because it will be integrated at the configuration level of interfaces (scripted into channels, etc.). This yields a defensive moat – removal would require reworking those pipelines.
	•	Continuous Feedback Loop: Pidgeon will sit at the nexus of testing, monitoring, and intelligence. Insights from production feeds can loop back to improve pre-production testing (e.g. auto-generating test cases from real anomalies, updating vendor profiles with new patterns observed). Conversely, our robust testing tools ensure that when changes are needed (maybe a new vendor spec or interface tweak), users can simulate them through Pidgeon before deploying. This dual presence means Pidgeon is involved in the full lifecycle of an interface. By Year 2, we envision introducing features like “Integration Simulation Mode,” where a live interface can be toggled into a safe test mode in Pidgeon to trial changes using real traffic patterns. This kind of capability is only possible when one platform straddles both dev and ops domains – a unique position for Pidgeon.
	•	Network Intelligence & Benchmarking: As Pidgeon’s footprint grows across institutions, we have an opportunity (with strict privacy controls) to deliver industry-wide intelligence. For example, if our de-identified data network detects that a certain EHR vendor’s HL7 feed is commonly causing errors after a specific version update, we could alert all clients using that vendor profile – essentially a community early warning system. We could provide benchmarking reports: “Interface X processes 10,000 messages/day at your site, which is 20% above average for similar-sized hospitals” – valuable for capacity planning and convincing stakeholders of performance needs. This creates a virtuous cycle: more users → more aggregate data → better insights → more value to users, which again attracts more users ￼ ￼. These network effects and the data moat (proprietary accumulation of cleaned healthcare messaging data) will be hard for any one competitor to replicate, especially if we are first movers.
	•	Reinforcing Zero-PHI Leadership: By being the observability layer that never compromises PHI, Pidgeon can gain trust and even influence industry best practices. We will showcase how it’s possible to monitor and analyze health data flows without exposing sensitive information – a big differentiator from generic log systems. Achieving things like HIPAA-compliant monitoring reports through deidentification will resonate strongly (e.g., generating audit logs of message flows that a compliance officer can use, without PHI, similar to SIEMs generating compliance evidence ￼). Pidgeon could become known as the safest way to handle interface data, which appeals to InfoSec and compliance teams (key allies in enterprise deals).
	•	After Interface Engines – The Next Wave: Finally, our platform approach positions us to define the future beyond traditional interface engines. If we consider interface engines the first generation (moving data), and Pidgeon’s observability the second (understanding data in motion), a potential third generation might be autonomous interface management. Pidgeon, with its AI and holistic view, could eventually not just observe but optimize and govern message flows across an organization. This could include intelligent routing (suggesting or automatically adjusting routes when one path fails), self-healing interfaces (retries, switches based on patterns), or even eventually offering a Pidgeon-run messaging backbone (if we ever choose to enter the messaging runtime space). Even if we don’t become an interface engine ourselves, by owning the brain that watches all engines, we already achieve the goal of being a permanent embedded piece. We’ll always be needed to provide the oversight and intelligence that pure engines lack.

In summary, this development plan takes Pidgeon’s strong North Star of faster, safer integration and extends it into a domain that multiplies our value proposition. We combine proven observability practices (from IT and security domains) with healthcare-specific innovation to create a platform hospitals can’t live without. Starting with Mirth for quick impact ￼, then layering on advanced analytics and multi-engine reach, we build momentum while addressing real market gaps. By thoughtfully using an open-core model, we maximize adoption and community support, which will fuel our feature development and provide market credibility (e.g. being seen as the thought leader in healthcare DevOps) ￼ ￼.

Through these steps, Pidgeon can truly become “the healthcare messaging platform that brings the next wave of native value after interface engines.” We will know we’ve achieved this when clients say: “Our interfaces run through Engine X, but all our knowledge and confidence about them comes from Pidgeon.” That is the North Star we aim for, and this plan charts a practical path to get there, balancing ambition with technological feasibility and business sustainability.
