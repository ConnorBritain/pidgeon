here’s a mature, opinionated tech stack + system design for Pidgeon that stays true to your C# core but thoughtfully expands where other languages/tech are the right tool for the job. I included three end-to-end “stack bundles” you can pick from (good → better → best for your goals), plus a concrete implementation plan and engine-specific (Mirth-first) steps.

⸻

guiding principles
	•	One core, many front-ends: the same generation/validation/diff/config logic serves both CLI and GUI.
	•	Engine-agnostic, vendor-aware: plug into Mirth first, but design for Rhapsody/Cloverleaf/Epic Bridges later.
	•	Zero-PHI by default: de-identify on the edge; never ship PHI off-box unless explicitly configured.
	•	Stream-first: interfaces produce events continuously; treat observability as streaming + aggregation + search.
	•	Open-core adoption: free agents + core -> paid analytics, governance, and managed cloud.

layer-by-layer stack recommendations

1) edge ingestion (engine plugins + sidecars)
	•	Mirth (first 6 months)
	•	Plugin/Polling: Java/Groovy plugin to query Mirth Admin REST APIs for channel stats, message/error counts; plus optional HTTP Sender to post structured events to Pidgeon.
	•	Sidecar agent: Go (small static binary, easy ops) to:
	•	tail logs / call APIs;
	•	De-identify on edge (HMAC-SHA256 for identifiers + deterministic salts; date shifting);
	•	batch and retry with offline buffer (SQLite/BadgerDB).
	•	Why not only C# here? JVM is native to Mirth; Go keeps footprint tiny and is ops-friendly on Linux/Windows.
	•	Later engines: adapters per engine (Rhapsody Java plugin; Cloverleaf SMAT reader; Bridges pullers). Keep agent protocol stable so only the adapter changes.

2) transport & ingestion
	•	Ingress: ASP.NET Core gRPC (preferred) + REST fallback; mutual TLS; OIDC for agent auth (client credentials).
	•	Message bus:
	•	Kafka (Confluent or Redpanda) if you expect high throughput and need durable streams.
	•	NATS JetStream if you want simpler ops, great for edge → core pipelines with at-least-once.
	•	Why: decouple ingest from processing; allow multiple processors (metrics, search, de-id lake) without re-sending.

3) stream processing
	•	.NET Background Workers (Hosted Services) for lightweight ETL, aggregation, and rules evaluation.
	•	For heavy stream analytics: Kafka Streams (Java) or Apache Flink (if you need stateful windows, joins, watermarks).
	•	Rules-as-data: keep thresholds/alerts/vendor-profile drift rules in Postgres, pulled into processors at runtime.

4) storage
	•	Operational DB: PostgreSQL (row-level security by org).
	•	Time series (interface metrics, latency, error rates):
	•	TimescaleDB (Postgres extension) for simplicity or ClickHouse for massive writes/rollups.
	•	Search & logs: OpenSearch (Elasticsearch-compatible) for fast fielded queries over de-identified content + error traces.
	•	Object storage (lake/lakehouse): S3/MinIO with Parquet; query with DuckDB (ad-hoc) and Trino/Presto (interactive, multi-user).
	•	Cache/queueing: Redis for hot paths (alert dedupe, session, rate-limit).

5) validation & standards services
	•	HL7 v2: keep your C# engine; add profile-driven checks; compile Z-segment rules.
	•	FHIR: run HAPI FHIR Validator as a sidecar JVM service (validated, mature), call via REST/gRPC; cache IGs.
	•	Terminology: Snowstorm (SNOMED), Ontoserver; or subscribe to cloud terminology but proxy/cache on-prem.

6) APIs & backend services
	•	ASP.NET Core (C#) for:
	•	GraphQL/REST for UI;
	•	org/projects/interfaces resources;
	•	alerting service (webhooks/email/Slack/Teams);
	•	report renderer (HTML/PDF).
	•	gRPC internally between services; REST externally for compatibility.
	•	AuthN/Z: OpenID Connect (Keycloak/Auth0/Azure AD); per-org RBAC; row-level security in Postgres + claims mapping.

7) UI
	•	Web: React + TypeScript, Next.js (SSR for enterprise SSO), Tailwind for speed.
	•	Desktop (optional): Tauri (Rust shell + web UI) for low-footprint cross-platform, or Electron if team is more familiar.
	•	Design system: shadcn/ui + custom charts; keep a consistent naming with CLI commands.

8) AI/ML add-ons (triage, anomaly, NL summaries)
	•	Local: vLLM/llama.cpp for on-prem inference (Pro/Ent).
	•	Pipelines: Python for notebooks/jobs, PyTorch where relevant; schedule with Airflow or Argo Workflows.
	•	Feature store: simple Postgres tables keyed by interface/channel/time; evolve later.

9) observability (of Pidgeon itself)
	•	OpenTelemetry everywhere → Prometheus + Grafana; Loki for app logs.
	•	Tracing: OTel trace IDs passed through ingest/processing so you can debug pipeline latency.

10) security & compliance
	•	Edge: de-ID before egress; mTLS from agent to gateway; per-org tenant token.
	•	Core: Vault for secrets; KMS envelope keys; FIPS-approved ciphers.
	•	Audit: append-only audit table (pg_partman), exportable to SIEM (CEF/JSON).
	•	Backups: PITR for Postgres; versioned S3 buckets for lake.
	•	SSO/SCIM: Enterprise tier.

three complete “stack bundles” (pick one)

A) .NET-First (fastest to MVP, minimal risk)
	•	Edge: Java/Groovy Mirth plugin + Go agent.
	•	Gateway & Services: ASP.NET Core, gRPC/REST, Hosted Services, EF Core to Postgres.
	•	Stream: Kafka (or NATS for simpler ops).
	•	Storage: Postgres + TimescaleDB, OpenSearch, S3/MinIO + Parquet (DuckDB).
	•	Validation: C# HL7; HAPI FHIR Validator sidecar.
	•	UI: Next.js (TS) Web; optional Tauri desktop shell.
	•	Ops: Kubernetes (AKS/EKS) + Helm; GitHub Actions; Terraform; OpenTelemetry + Prometheus/Grafana.

When to choose: you want to move quickly, leverage your C# strength, and still scale.

⸻

B) Pragmatic Polyglot (maximum performance & portability)
	•	Edge: Rust agent (tailed logs, de-ID, minimal RAM/CPU) + Java/Groovy plugin for Mirth.
	•	Stream: Redpanda (Kafka API, easier ops) + Flink for advanced windows/anomaly.
	•	Metrics: ClickHouse (fast TS rollups).
	•	Search: OpenSearch.
	•	Core APIs: ASP.NET Core or Go microservices for ultra-small containers.
	•	UI: Next.js; Desktop Tauri.
	•	AI: vLLM with GPU when on-prem.

When to choose: you’re optimizing for low footprint agents and very high throughput analytics.

⸻

C) Lean On-Prem (small IT teams, minimal dependencies)
	•	Edge: Java/Groovy plugin + Go agent with SQLite buffer.
	•	No Kafka initially: push straight to gateway; Hangfire/.NET background jobs for ETL.
	•	Storage: Postgres (+ Timescale), OpenSearch optional; MinIO for local object storage.
	•	UI/APIs: Single ASP.NET Core monolith; deploy via Docker Compose (single-node).
	•	Validators: same as A.

When to choose: quickest path for a hospital pilot, air-gapped, low ops burden.

⸻

initial data model (seed)
	•	org(id, name, settings_json)
	•	engine(id, org_id, type, name, endpoint, auth)
	•	interface(id, org_id, engine_id, channel_id, standard, vendor, profile_id)
	•	event_metric_hourly(interface_id, ts, msgs_in, msgs_out, errors, p95_latency_ms)  ← Timescale hypertable
	•	alert_rule(id, org_id, interface_id, rule_type, threshold, window, severity)
	•	alert_event(id, org_id, interface_id, ts, rule_id, payload_json, status)
	•	message_index (OpenSearch): {org_id, interface_id, msg_type, fields…, error_flag, hash_id}
	•	deid_map(org_id, source_id_type, source_value_hash, salted_hash, created_at)
	•	vendor_profile(id, org_id, name, rules_json, version, created_at)

Row-level security on all org-scoped tables; hash mapping only stores salted hashes (never raw).

⸻

concrete implementation plan (12 months)

months 0–2 (MVP plumbing)
	•	Mirth plugin + Go agent: poll stats, post to gateway; edge de-ID; offline buffer.
	•	Gateway & minimal pipeline: ASP.NET Core gRPC/REST; Postgres + Timescale; alerting worker; Slack/Email integration.
	•	Dashboards v0: Interface list + status + sparkline charts; set alert thresholds.
	•	Validation loop: failed messages (samples) posted to validation API; store triage results.

Deliverable: Mirth observability MVP in one hospital sandbox.

months 3–5 (analytics basics)
	•	OpenSearch indexer: structured error docs & selected de-ID fields searchable.
	•	Lake v0: MinIO/S3 + Parquet writer; DuckDB query endpoint for reports.
	•	Dashboards v1: OOTB reports (errors over time, latency, volume by msg type).
	•	Drift detection: compare live messages vs vendor_profile; raise alerts.

Deliverable: first ops + clinical dashboards; drift alerts proven in the wild.

months 6–8 (AI & FHIR breadth)
	•	HAPI FHIR validator sidecar + IG caching; FHIR resource diffs.
	•	Anomaly detection: simple statistical baselines (EWMA/z-score) → alerts.
	•	AI triage: local/vLLM text summaries for alert context (“likely root cause…”).
	•	GUI polish: workflows from alert → validate → suggested fix.

Deliverable: assistant-grade triage + better FHIR credibility.

months 9–12 (multi-engine + packaging)
	•	Rhapsody adapter (Java plugin) or SMAT reader for Cloverleaf (pick one with a design partner).
	•	Installers: Helm charts (SaaS/hybrid), Docker Compose (on-prem single-node).
	•	RBAC/SSO: OIDC; audit trails; API tokens per org.
	•	Usage metering & licensing: free core vs Pro/Ent gates; seat & interface limits.

Deliverable: 2nd engine support; enterprise-ready packaging and auth.

⸻

risks & mitigation
	•	Free-tier cannibalization → gate long-term retention, AI insights, multi-engine correlation, SSO/audit behind Pro/Ent; keep free dashboards basic.
	•	PHI leakage → enforce edge de-ID; block raw content at gateway by default; provide “PHI passthrough” only under explicit org policy with additional encryption.
	•	Agent sprawl/maintenance → keep agent protocol stable; e2e health checks; auto-update channels; minimal config (env vars).
	•	Kafka ops complexity → start with NATS or go monolith (bundle C) for first pilots; add Kafka only when necessary.
	•	Validator performance → cache IGs; parallelize HAPI calls; pre-validate common patterns; use queue backpressure.

⸻

why these language choices
	•	C#/.NET: you already have momentum; superb for web APIs, workers, Windows+Linux support, perf is more than enough.
	•	Java (Mirth/HAPI): JVM is native to Mirth; HAPI Validator is the industry workhorse for FHIR IGs.
	•	Go (edge agent): tiny static binaries, easy cross-compiles, resilient networking/IO—ideal for hospital IT ops.
	•	Rust (optional): when you need ultra-low overhead (agent) or high-perf parsers/diff engines later.
	•	TypeScript/React: ubiquity, speed of iteration, enterprise-friendly SSO story with Next.js.

⸻

deployment topologies
	•	On-prem single node (pilot): Docker Compose stack (Gateway+API+UI+Postgres+MinIO+OpenSearch).
	•	Hybrid: on-prem agents + cloud dashboards (only de-ID content/statistics leave site).
	•	SaaS: cloud multi-tenant; per-org VPC peering optional for larger customers.

⸻

open-core packaging (practical)
	•	Open: agents, engine adapters, core CLI/SDK, base dashboards, API schemas.
	•	Pro: advanced dashboards, analytics retention >30 days, AI/triage, drift matrix, report templates, limited multi-engine.
	•	Enterprise: full multi-engine, SSO/SCIM, audit, on-prem installers, custom IG hosting, SLAs.

⸻

if you want a “just tell me what to pick” answer
	•	Pick Bundle A (.NET-First) now.
	•	Add NATS (not Kafka) for the first 2 pilots.
	•	Store metrics in Timescale, search in OpenSearch, blobs in MinIO.
	•	Run HAPI FHIR Validator as a sidecar.
	•	Build Go agent + Mirth plugin first; Rhapsody next.
	•	UI: Next.js web; add Tauri desktop later if demand appears.
	•	Ship via Helm (cloud/hybrid) and Compose (on-prem).
	•	Instrument everything with OpenTelemetry from day one.

This combo gets you to a credible, deployable MVP quickly, keeps ops sane, and leaves you room to scale or swap parts later.
