# Pidgeon Development Plan - Current Status & Next Steps
**Version**: 2.0  
**Updated**: September 1, 2025  
**Status**: Authoritative development roadmap  
**Scope**: Foundation repair through P0 MVP delivery

---

## 🚨 **CRITICAL: Current Status**

### **🔍 Architectural Review Context**
**ESSENTIAL READING**: The foundation work detailed below is based on comprehensive architectural analysis:
- **[`docs/arch_reviews/PIDGEON_AR_FINAL.md`](arch_reviews/PIDGEON_AR_FINAL.md)** - Complete findings across 5 review phases
- **[`docs/arch_reviews/ar_082925/`](arch_reviews/ar_082925/)** - Detailed analysis logs with specific file:line references
- **[`docs/LEDGER.md`](LEDGER.md)** - Historical decisions that created current technical debt

**⚠️ CRITICAL**: These documents contain the exact file locations, line numbers, and root cause analysis needed to execute foundation repairs correctly. Do NOT proceed with domain boundary fixes without referencing the specific violations documented in the architectural review.

### **Foundation Health Assessment**
**Architectural Health Score**: **87/100** - Strong foundation with critical violations  
**P0 Readiness**: ❌ **NOT READY** - Foundation work required first  
**Required Work**: **97-145 hours** (realistic: 3.25 weeks) before P0 development

**Evidence Base**: Assessment based on systematic review of 131/146 files (90% manual coverage) across 5 comprehensive phases of architectural analysis.

### **Build Status**
✅ **Clean Build**: 0 compilation errors, 0 warnings  
✅ **Tests Passing**: Core functionality validated  
✅ **Plugin Architecture**: Sophisticated implementation working  
❌ **Domain Boundaries**: 21 critical violations (see PIDGEON_AR_FINAL.md Section 4.1)
❌ **Code Duplication**: 600+ duplicate lines identified (see PIDGEON_AR_FINAL.md Section 4.4)

## 📋 **Phase 0: Foundation Repair (Weeks 1-3)**
**Goal**: Achieve 95/100 architectural health before P0 development  
**Duration**: 3-4 weeks  
**Team Focus**: Architecture, code quality, technical debt elimination

### **Week 1: Critical Domain Fixes**
**Duration**: 40 hours  
**Priority**: CRITICAL - P0 blocking

#### **Domain Boundary Violations (Days 1-3)**
**Reference**: [`PIDGEON_AR_FINAL.md` Sections 4.1-4.2](arch_reviews/PIDGEON_AR_FINAL.md) for complete violation analysis

- **Move HL7Field Types**: Infrastructure → Domain.Messaging.HL7v2.Common
- **Remove Infrastructure Dependencies**: Fix 12 files importing Infrastructure.Standards.Common.HL7
- **Create Clinical→Messaging Adapters**: Replace 21 direct imports with proper adapters
- **Files to Fix** (documented in PIDGEON_AR_FINAL.md):
  - `PIDSegment.cs:5` → Clinical.Entities
  - `ORCSegment.cs:5` → Clinical.Entities  
  - `RXESegment.cs:5` → Clinical.Entities
  - `PV1Segment.cs:5` → Clinical.Entities
  - `ADTMessage.cs:5` → Clinical.Entities
  - `RDEMessage.cs:5` → Clinical.Entities

**Root Cause**: Clean Architecture reorganization (ARCH-024) broke plugin access patterns without completing adapter implementations.

#### **Critical FIXME Resolution (Days 4-5)**
**Reference**: [`PIDGEON_AR_FINAL.md` Section 4.3](arch_reviews/PIDGEON_AR_FINAL.md) for complete FIXME analysis

- **HL7Message.cs**: Lines 267, 512 - parsing implementation TODOs
- **GenericHL7Message.cs**: Lines 27, 36 - debug format support TODOs

**Root Cause**: Architectural migrations left incomplete when domain boundaries were reorganized.

**Week 1 Success Criteria**:
- ✅ Zero domain boundary violations
- ✅ Zero infrastructure dependencies in domain
- ✅ All P0-blocking TODOs completed
- ✅ Domain architecture score >90/100

### **Week 2: Code Duplication Elimination**
