```yaml
Priority: Enable team collaboration with non-PHI cloud services
Investment: $300K-$500K
Certifications: SOC2 Type II
Benefits:
  - Enterprise credibility
  - Hybrid cloud capabilities
  - Team collaboration features
```

#### **Year 3+: Full Compliance Suite**
```yaml
Priority: Complete healthcare cloud platform

  - Full-service cloud offerings
  - Maximum market addressability
  - Premium pricing power
```

### **Implementation Priorities**

1. **Security Architecture**: Zero trust principles from day one
2. **On-Premise Deployment**: Healthcare-friendly Windows-first approach  
3. **Hybrid Model**: Non-PHI cloud services for collaboration
4. **Compliance Readiness**: Document and implement controls early
5. **Certification Path**: SOC2 first, then healthcare-specific compliance

This approach balances healthcare market requirements with practical business constraints while establishing a foundation for long-term compliance and security excellence.
