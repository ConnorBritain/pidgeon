# Product Overview

## Segmint Healthcare Interoperability Platform

An AI-augmented, universal healthcare standards platform that provides free basic generation for HL7, FHIR, and NCPDP SCRIPT, with premium features for professional productivity and enterprise governance.

### Core Functionality

**Universal Healthcare Message Platform (Core+ Strategy):**
- Generates test messages across THREE standards: HL7 v2.x, FHIR R4, NCPDP SCRIPT
- **Real-world compatible validation** with strict mode vs compatibility mode for handling spec violations
- **Vendor-specific configuration inference** from sample messages (Epic, Cerner, CorEMR patterns)
- **Baseline configuration library** with pre-built templates for common EHR implementations
- Unified domain model allows same data to generate different standard formats
- AI-powered features (with BYOK) for mapping and documentation

### Key Business Value

- **Universal Coverage**: Only free tool supporting all three major standards
- **Real-World Ready**: Liberal validation accepts messy real-world HL7, strict mode ensures compliance
- **Instant Vendor Onboarding**: Infer interface specifications from sample messages in minutes
- **Time Savings**: Generate hundreds of test messages matching actual vendor patterns
- **Quality Assurance**: Multi-level validation against both specs and real-world implementations
- **AI Augmentation**: Optional AI accelerates mapping and documentation by 80%
- **Zero Lock-in**: Open source core with MPL 2.0 license

### Target Users

- **Healthcare IT Interface Engineers**: Need daily testing/validation across standards
- **Integration Consultants**: Require portable tools for client projects
- **Hospital IT Departments**: Managing interfaces between dozens of systems
- **EHR/Lab/Pharmacy Vendors**: Testing their interface implementations
- **Mirth Refugees**: Organizations seeking alternatives after v4.6 closure

### System Boundaries

- **Input**: Healthcare data models, raw messages, configuration files
- **Processing**: Generation, parsing, validation, transformation, mapping
- **Output**: Valid messages in HL7/FHIR/NCPDP formats, documentation, error reports
- **External Dependencies**: Optional AI services (OpenAI), terminology services
