## ‚ùå MISSING FEATURE (Implementation Required)

### 4. Shell Completion - **NOT IMPLEMENTED**
**Status**: Documented in `docs/dev_scratchpads/SHELL_COMPLETION.md` but no implementation found

**Gap Analysis**:
- ‚ùå No completion provider implementations
- ‚ùå No installation scripts for bash/zsh/powershell
- ‚ùå No completion context awareness
- ‚ùå No dynamic completions for model IDs, workflow names, etc.

**Implementation Estimate**: 2-3 days of development work

**Impact on Ship**: **Low** - Shell completion is a quality-of-life feature, not blocking for professional usage
