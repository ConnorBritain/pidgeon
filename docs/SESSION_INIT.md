# Agent Session Initialization Protocol
**Purpose**: Single command to fully initialize AI agents for Pidgeon development  
**Usage**: "Read `docs/SESSION_INIT.md` and follow its initialization protocol"  
**Result**: Agent understands current state, rules, priorities, and can begin productive work immediately  

---

## üö® **MANDATORY INITIALIZATION SEQUENCE**

### **Step 1: Read Core Rules & Context** ‚≠ê
**Command**: Read these documents in order:
1. **`docs/RULES.md`** - Sacred principles, anti-patterns, validation rules
2. **`docs/arch_reviews/ARCH_FIX.md`** - Current rehabilitation roadmap with specific tasks
3. **`docs/DEVELOPMENT.md`** - Strategic direction and P0 feature priorities

### **Step 2: Assess Current State** ‚≠ê
**Commands**:
```bash
git status                    # Check working directory state
git log --oneline -5         # Recent development activity
grep -c "TODO:\|FIXME:" src/**/*.cs  # Current technical debt count
```

### **Step 3: Validate Understanding** ‚≠ê
**Confirm you understand**:
- **Current Phase**: Foundation rehabilitation (Week 1-3 of ARCH_FIX.md)
- **Blocker Status**: P0 domain violations must be fixed before any feature work
- **Architecture**: Four-domain model with plugin architecture
- **Error Protocol**: STOP-THINK-ACT methodology is mandatory

## üìä **CURRENT STATE SUMMARY**
*Last Updated: September 2, 2025*

### **Project Status**
- **Phase**: Architectural rehabilitation sprint (Week 1 of 3-4)
- **Health Score**: 87/100 (Strong foundation with critical violations)
- **Build Status**: ‚úÖ Clean (0 errors, 0 warnings)
- **P0 MVP Status**: ‚ùå BLOCKED by architectural violations

### **Critical Path**
1. **CURRENT PRIORITY**: P0 domain boundary violations (21 files)
2. **Next Week**: Code duplication patterns (600+ duplicate lines)
3. **Week 3**: P0-blocking TODOs and validation
4. **Gate to P0**: Health score >95/100, foundation ready

### **Business Context**
- **Model**: Core+ (Free algorithmic core + Paid AI/GUI/Cloud)
- **Target Users**: Healthcare developers, consultants, informaticists, administrators
- **Mission**: AI-augmented universal healthcare standards platform (HL7, FHIR, NCPDP)

## üéØ **IMMEDIATE ACTION GUIDANCE**

### **If User Asks for Feature Work**:
**Response**: "I need to fix critical architectural violations first. We have 21 domain boundary violations blocking P0 development. Would you like me to start with those?"

### **If User Reports Errors**:
**Response**: Follow STOP-THINK-ACT protocol from `docs/RULES.md`. Don't fix immediately - analyze first.

### **If User Wants Architecture Changes**:
**Response**: Reference `docs/roadmap/INIT.md` sacred principles. Propose changes that align with four-domain architecture.

### **If User Wants New Standards Support**:
**Response**: Implement as plugin following existing HL7v23Plugin pattern. Never modify core services.

## üöÄ **PRODUCTIVITY PATTERNS**

### **Session Start Checklist**
- [ ] Read RULES.md (understand constraints)
- [ ] Read ARCH_FIX.md (understand current priorities)
- [ ] Check git status (understand working state)
- [ ] Identify current sprint week (Week 1/2/3 of rehabilitation)
- [ ] Confirm task alignment with current phase

### **Before Any Code Changes**
- [ ] Validate against `docs/RULES.md` principles
- [ ] Check if task is P0-priority in `docs/arch_reviews/ARCH_FIX.md`
- [ ] Ensure no architectural violations will be introduced
- [ ] Plan testing approach per healthcare scenarios

### **Error Handling Protocol**
- [ ] STOP: Don't immediately fix
- [ ] THINK: Root cause analysis per `error-resolution-methodology.md`
- [ ] ACT: Minimal principled changes
- [ ] Document in required format

## üí° **COMMON SESSION WORKFLOWS**

### **Architecture Fix Session**
1. Read SESSION_INIT.md (this document)
2. Identify current P0-P1 priority from ARCH_FIX.md
3. Read specific file violations listed
4. Plan fix strategy using RULES.md patterns
5. Implement with STOP-THINK-ACT for any errors
6. Update ARCH_FIX.md checkboxes when complete

### **Feature Development Session**
1. Read SESSION_INIT.md (this document)
2. Confirm foundation is ready (ARCH_FIX.md P0 complete)
3. Read relevant user stories from BACKLOG.md
4. Implement using four-domain architecture

```
Read docs/SESSION_INIT.md, follow its initialization protocol, then tell me what phase we're in and what you recommend we work on next.
```

### **Status Check Commands**
```bash
# Architecture health check
grep -c "TODO:\|FIXME:" src/**/*.cs

# Domain violation check  
grep -r "using.*Clinical" src/Pidgeon.Core/Domain/Messaging/

# Current git state
git status && git log --oneline -3
```

### **Ready-to-Work Confirmation**
**Agent should respond with**:
"Ready! We're in architectural rehabilitation Week X. Current priority is [specific P0 task from ARCH_FIX.md]. Shall I begin with [specific action]?"
