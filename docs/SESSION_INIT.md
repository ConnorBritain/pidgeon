# Agent Session Initialization Protocol
**Purpose**: Single command to fully initialize AI agents for Pidgeon development  
**Usage**: "Read `docs/SESSION_INIT.md` and follow its initialization protocol"  
**Result**: Agent understands current state, rules, priorities, and can begin productive work immediately  

---

## üö® **MANDATORY INITIALIZATION SEQUENCE**

### **Step 1: Read Core Rules & Current Roadmap** ‚≠ê
**Command**: Read these documents in order:
1. **`docs/roadmap/PIDGEON_ROADMAP.md`** - Master P0-P2 roadmap with success criteria
2. **`docs/roadmap/features/NORTHSTAR.md`** - North star vision and product focus
3. **`docs/roadmap/CLI_REFERENCE.md`** - Complete CLI structure for P0 development
4. **`docs/DEVELOPMENT.md`** - Current status (foundation complete) and P0 features
5. **`docs/RULES.md`** - Sacred architectural principles (still enforced)

### **Step 2: Assess Current State** ‚≠ê
**Commands**:
```bash
git status                    # Check working directory state
git log --oneline -5         # Recent development activity
grep -c "TODO:\|FIXME:" src/**/*.cs  # Current technical debt count
```

### **Step 3: Validate Understanding** ‚≠ê
**Confirm you understand**:
- **Current Phase**: P0 MVP development (foundation complete at 100/100 health)
- **North Star**: "Realistic scenario testing without PHI compliance nightmare"
- **P0 Features**: 6 core features in embryonic development sequence (generate‚Üídeident‚Üívalidate‚Üíconfig‚Üíworkflow‚Üídiff)
- **CLI-First**: One engine, two frontends strategy with Free/Pro/Enterprise gating
- **Architecture**: Four-domain model with plugin architecture (fully implemented)
- **Error Protocol**: STOP-THINK-ACT methodology still mandatory

## üìä **CURRENT STATE SUMMARY**
*Last Updated: September 5, 2025*

### **Project Status**
- **Phase**: P0 MVP Development (foundation rehabilitation complete)
- **Health Score**: 100/100 (Perfect architectural foundation)
- **Build Status**: ‚úÖ Clean (0 errors, 43 tests passing)
- **P0 MVP Status**: ‚úÖ READY for feature development

### **P0 Embryonic Development Plan (8 weeks)**
**Rationale**: Compound growth sequence where each feature builds on previous intelligence
1. **Weeks 1-2**: Generation Engine (foundational heartbeat - creates test data supply)
2. **Week 3**: De-identification (major differentiation - unlocks real data segment)  
3. **Week 4**: Validation Engine (quality control - creates feedback loops)
4. **Week 5**: Vendor Pattern Detection (network effects - builds proprietary intelligence)
5. **Week 6**: Workflow Wizard [Pro] (natural revenue conversion using compound intelligence)
6. **Weeks 7-8**: Diff + AI Triage [Pro] (advanced troubleshooting - ultimate compound feature)

### **Business Context**
- **North Star**: "Realistic scenario testing without PHI compliance nightmare"
- **Model**: CLI-first with GUI harmony (Free CLI + Pro/Enterprise features)
- **Target Users**: Healthcare developers, consultants, informaticists, administrators
- **Mission**: Transform healthcare testing through synthetic data & de-identification

## üéØ **IMMEDIATE ACTION GUIDANCE**

### **If User Asks for Feature Work**:
**Response**: "Foundation is complete! We're ready for P0 development. Which P0 feature should we work on: generate, validate, deident, config, workflow, or diff?"

### **If User Reports Errors**:
**Response**: Follow STOP-THINK-ACT protocol from `docs/RULES.md`. Don't fix immediately - analyze first.

### **If User Wants CLI Commands**:
**Response**: Reference `docs/roadmap/features/cli_baseline.md` for exact command structure. Implement with clear Free/Pro gating.

### **If User Wants New Standards Support**:
**Response**: Implement as plugin following existing HL7v23Plugin pattern. Never modify core services.

### **If User Wants GUI Features**:
**Response**: Follow CLI-GUI harmonization strategy - one engine, two frontends. GUI operations export CLI equivalents.
