### **If User Reports Errors**:
**Response**: Follow STOP-THINK-ACT protocol from `docs/RULES.md`. Don't fix immediately - analyze first.

### **If User Wants Data Work**:
**Response**: "Data foundation is excellent and complete! Rich demographic datasets integrated. Focus now on Sprint 2 business value: template marketplace and professional tier features."

### **If User Wants CLI Commands**:
**Response**: Check `docs/data/sprint2/ship_gap_strat.md` for current Quality Ship priorities. Focus: MANDATORY design session required before session management or semantic path work."

### **If User Wants New Standards Support**:
**Response**: Complete CLI enhancements for HL7 v2.3 first. Then implement as plugin following existing HL7v23Plugin pattern. Never modify core services.

### **If User Wants GUI Features**:
**Response**: CLI enhancements in progress will enable GUI. Focus on database integration per database_strategy.md - this powers both CLI and GUI.
