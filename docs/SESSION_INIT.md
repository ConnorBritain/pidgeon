# Agent Session Initialization Protocol
**Purpose**: Single command to fully initialize AI agents for Pidgeon development  
**Usage**: "Read `docs/SESSION_INIT.md` and follow its initialization protocol"  
**Result**: Agent understands current state, rules, priorities, and can begin productive work immediately  

---

## üö® **MANDATORY INITIALIZATION SEQUENCE**

### **Step 1: Read Core Rules & Current Roadmap** ‚≠ê
**Command**: Read these documents in order:
1. **`docs/roadmap/PIDGEON_ROADMAP.md`** - Master P0-P2 roadmap with success criteria
2. **`docs/roadmap/features/NORTHSTAR.md`** - North star vision and product focus
3. **`docs/roadmap/CLI_REFERENCE.md`** - Complete CLI structure for P0 development
4. **`docs/roadmap/CLI_DEVELOPMENT_STATUS.md`** - **[CRITICAL]** Current CLI status with detailed lookup analysis
5. **`docs/roadmap/data_integrity/data_mvp.md`** - **[CRITICAL]** 80/20 strategy for data completeness and MVP priorities
6. **`docs/roadmap/data_integrity/HL7_REFERENCE_GUIDE.md`** - **[DEFINITIVE]** Official HL7 v2.3 standards navigation and compliance framework
7. **`docs/roadmap/data_integrity/HL7_PRIORITY_ITEMS.md`** - **[MVP CRITICAL]** Rank-ordered 20-50 priority items per category for systematic development
8. **`docs/DATA_SPRINT.md`** - **[ACTIVE SPRINT]** Current data migration process and multi-agent coordination
8. **`docs/DEVELOPMENT.md`** - Current status (foundation complete) and P0 features
9. **`docs/RULES.md`** - Sacred architectural principles (still enforced)
10. **`pidgeon/data/standards/hl7v23/_TEMPLATES/README.md`** - **[MANDATORY]** JSON template patterns for all data files
11. **`pidgeon/data/standards/hl7v23/_TEMPLATES/CLEANUP.md`** - **[REQUIRED]** Data file rehabilitation process

### **Step 2: Assess Current State** ‚≠ê
**Commands**:
```bash
git status                    # Check working directory state
git log --oneline -5         # Recent development activity
grep -c "TODO:\|FIXME:" src/**/*.cs  # Current technical debt count
```

### **Step 3: Validate Understanding** ‚≠ê
**Confirm you understand**:
- **Current Phase**: üîç **P0 MVP Data Foundation Work** - Critical segment fields missing (September 16, 2025)
- **Major Finding**: CLI lookup effectiveness reduced from 70% to 40% due to incomplete segment data
- **North Star**: "Realistic scenario testing without PHI compliance nightmare"
- **Critical Priority**: Complete missing PID/PV1 segment fields that reference existing tables
- **Template Compliance**: ALL new data files must follow `_TEMPLATES/` patterns exactly
- **Data Cleanup**: Existing files need systematic remediation per `CLEANUP.md`
- **CLI Status**: Table foundation excellent (20/20), segment fields critical gap
- **Architecture**: Four-domain model + plugin patterns still enforced
- **Error Protocol**: STOP-THINK-ACT methodology still mandatory

## üö® **CRITICAL DATA FOUNDATION WORK REQUIRED**

### **Immediate Priority: Complete Missing Segment Fields**
**Critical Finding**: Lookup command effectiveness is only 40% due to missing segment field definitions despite excellent table foundation (20/20 critical tables complete).

### **P0 Critical Work Required:**
1. **Complete PID Segment Fields** - Missing PID.16 (Marital Status), PID.10 (Race), PID.17 (Religion)
2. **Complete PV1 Segment Fields** - Missing PV1.2 (Patient Class), PV1.4 (Admission Type), PV1.14 (Admit Source)
3. **Fix Message Pattern Recognition** - Enable `pidgeon lookup ADT_A01` functionality
4. **ALL work must follow `_TEMPLATES/` patterns** - No exceptions for consistency

## üéØ **IMMEDIATE ACTION GUIDANCE**

### **If User Asks for Feature Work**:
**Response**: "Critical data foundation gap identified. CLI lookup only 40% effective due to missing segment fields. Must complete PID/PV1 fields first before P1 expansion - tables exist, just need field definitions."

### **If User Reports Errors**:
**Response**: Follow STOP-THINK-ACT protocol from `docs/RULES.md`. Don't fix immediately - analyze first.

### **If User Wants Data Work**:
**Response**: MANDATORY - Use `pidgeon/data/standards/hl7v23/_TEMPLATES/` patterns. Read `README.md` and `CLEANUP.md` first. No exceptions for consistency.

### **If User Wants CLI Commands**:
**Response**: Check `docs/roadmap/CLI_DEVELOPMENT_STATUS.md` first for current gaps. Priority is completing missing segment fields, not new commands.

### **If User Wants New Standards Support**:
**Response**: Complete HL7 v2.3 segment foundation first. Then implement as plugin following existing HL7v23Plugin pattern. Never modify core services.

### **If User Wants GUI Features**:
**Response**: Critical CLI lookup gaps must be resolved first. CLI effectiveness only 40% due to missing segment data. GUI depends on functional CLI foundation.
