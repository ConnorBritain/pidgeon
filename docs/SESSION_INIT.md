### **If User Reports Errors**:
**Response**: Follow STOP-THINK-ACT protocol from `docs/RULES.md`. Don't fix immediately - analyze first.

### **If User Wants CLI Commands**:
**Response**: Reference `docs/roadmap/features/cli_baseline.md` for exact command structure. Implement with clear Free/Pro gating.

### **If User Wants New Standards Support**:
**Response**: Implement as plugin following existing HL7v23Plugin pattern. Never modify core services.

### **If User Wants GUI Features**:
**Response**: Follow CLI-GUI harmonization strategy - one engine, two frontends. GUI operations export CLI equivalents.
