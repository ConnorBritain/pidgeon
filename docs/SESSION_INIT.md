# Agent Session Initialization Protocol
**Purpose**: Single command to fully initialize AI agents for Pidgeon development  
**Usage**: "Read `docs/SESSION_INIT.md` and follow its initialization protocol"  
**Result**: Agent understands current state, rules, priorities, and can begin productive work immediately

## üö® **MANDATORY INITIALIZATION SEQUENCE**

### **Step 1: Read Core Rules & Current Roadmap** ‚≠ê
**Command**: Read these documents in order:
1. **`docs/roadmap/PIDGEON_ROADMAP.md`** - Master P0-P2 roadmap with success criteria
2. **`docs/roadmap/features/NORTHSTAR.md`** - North star vision and product focus
3. **`docs/roadmap/CLI_REFERENCE.md`** - Complete CLI structure for P0 development
4. **`pidgeon/docs/data/sprint1_09182025/data-enriched-cli-improvement-plan.md`** - **[CURRENT SPRINT]** Active CLI enhancement using existing data
5. **`docs/DATA_SPRINT.md`** - **[ACTIVE SPRINT]** Data utilization and CLI integration
6. **`docs/roadmap/database_strategy.md`** - **[CRITICAL]** SQLite database integration for CLI
7. **`docs/DEVELOPMENT.md`** - Current status (foundation complete) and P0 features
8. **`docs/RULES.md`** - Sacred architectural principles (still enforced)

### **Step 2: Assess Current State** ‚≠ê
**Commands**:
```bash
git status                    # Check working directory state
git log --oneline -5         # Recent development activity
grep -c "TODO:\|FIXME:" src/**/*.cs  # Current technical debt count
```

### **Step 3: Validate Understanding** ‚≠ê
**Confirm you understand**:
- **Current Phase**: üöÄ **Data-Enriched CLI Sprint** - Leveraging existing 96 segments, 90+ data types, 306 tables
- **Major Finding**: Core data is excellent, need enhanced CLI access to tables/trigger events
- **North Star**: "Realistic scenario testing without PHI compliance nightmare"
- **Critical Priority**: 1) Enable table/trigger event lookup 2) SQLite database integration 3) Wire up generation/validation
- **Data Status**: Rich competitive datasets (500+ demographic values) ready for use
- **CLI Status**: Segments/datatypes work perfectly, tables/triggers need path recognition
- **Architecture**: Four-domain model + plugin patterns still enforced
- **Error Protocol**: STOP-THINK-ACT methodology still mandatory
