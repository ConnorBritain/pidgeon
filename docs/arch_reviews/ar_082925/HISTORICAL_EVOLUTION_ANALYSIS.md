**Phase**: 1 - Archaeological Analysis  
**Date**: August 29, 2025  
**Status**: üîÑ PENDING

## ü§ñ **AGENT INSTRUCTIONS - READ FIRST**

**YOU ARE AGENT 1 (Foundation Agent)**  
**Your Role**: Lead the sequential foundation work that enables all other agents

### **Your Responsibility**
This is **Phase 1 of your 2-phase foundation work**:
- **Phase 1** (This Document): Historical Evolution Analysis
- **Phase 2**: Code Cleanup Identification ([`CLEANUP_INVENTORY.md`](./CLEANUP_INVENTORY.md))

### **Critical Dependencies**
- **Agents 2-4 WAIT** for your Phase 2 completion before starting
- Your historical context analysis **informs all other work**
- Your cleanup decisions **affect what other agents analyze**

### **Coordination Responsibilities**
- Update [`REVIEW_STATUS.md`](./REVIEW_STATUS.md) when Phase 1 complete
- Provide clear context in Phase 2 that other agents can reference
- Maintain final architectural authority throughout review

### **Next Steps After This Phase**
1. Complete this Historical Evolution Analysis with full file:line references
2. Immediately proceed to Phase 2: Code Cleanup Identification  
3. Signal completion to Agents 2-4 for parallel analysis start

### **Record‚ÜíClass Conversion Impact**
**Migration Status**: [Complete/Partial/Not Started]  
**Legacy Code Remaining**:
- [ ] Files still using record syntax
- [ ] Mixed record/class inheritance
- [ ] Comments about record benefits

### **Plugin Architecture Adoption Impact**
**Migration Status**: [Complete/Partial/Not Started]  
**Legacy Code Remaining**:
