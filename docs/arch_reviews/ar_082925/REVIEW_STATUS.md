## 🎯 **Current Stage Status**

### **Stage 1: Sequential Foundation (Agent 1)**
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE  
**Critical Path**: Agent 1 must complete both phases before Stage 2 begins

- **Phase 1**: Historical Evolution Analysis - ✅ COMPLETE
- **Phase 2**: Code Cleanup Identification - ✅ COMPLETE

**Stage 1 Gate**: ✅ STAGE 1 COMPLETE → STAGE 2 PARALLEL WORK CAN BEGIN

---

### **Stage 2: Parallel Analysis (Agents 2-4)**
**Status**: 🚦 READY TO BEGIN  
**Trigger**: ✅ Stage 1 completion signal received from Agent 1

- **Phase 3**: Agent 2 (Sacred Principles & SRP) - ✅ COMPLETE
- **Phase 4**: Agent 3 (DRY & Technical Debt) - 🚦 READY TO BEGIN  
- **Phase 5**: Agent 4 (Coherence Assessment) - 🚦 READY TO BEGIN

**Stage 2 Gate**: ✅ All three phases complete → Stage 3 begins

---

### **Stage 3: Consolidation (Agent 1)**
**Status**: ⚪ WAITING FOR STAGE 2  
**Trigger**: All Stage 2 agents signal completion

- **Consolidation**: Merge findings into unified architectural health report - ⚪ WAITING
- **Fix Implementation**: Critical issues resolution - ⚪ WAITING
- **P0 Readiness**: Final assessment and recommendation - ⚪ WAITING

## 🔄 **Agent Status Updates**

### **Agent 1 (Foundation Agent)**
**Current Task**: Phase 2 - Code Cleanup Identification  
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE  
**Branch**: `AR1&2/historical+cleanup`  
**Dependencies**: ✅ Phase 1 completed  
**Next Action**: ✅ STAGE 1 COMPLETE - Wait for Agents 2-4 to complete Stage 2  

**Coordination Responsibility**: 
- ✅ Signal Stage 2 start when Phase 2 complete
- 🔄 Monitor REVIEW_STATUS.md for Stage 2 completion signals
- ⏳ Lead Stage 3 consolidation when all agents complete

### **Agent 2 (Architecture Agent)**
**Current Task**: Phase 3 - Fundamental Analysis  
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE  
**Branch**: `AR3/fundamentals`  
**Dependencies**: ✅ Agent 1 Phase 2 completion  
**Next Action**: ✅ PHASE 3 COMPLETE - Waiting for Agents 3-4 to complete Stage 2  

**Work Completed**: 
- ✅ Sacred Principles compliance analysis (100% file coverage)
- ✅ Single Responsibility Principle violations identified
- ✅ 50+ architectural violations documented with file:line references
- ✅ Executive summary with actionable remediation roadmap
- ✅ FUNDAMENTAL_ANALYSIS.md completed with audit-grade thoroughness

**Key Findings**: 18 critical architecture issues identified requiring immediate action, strong foundation with systematic fixes needed

### **Agent 3 (Quality Agent)**  
**Current Task**: Waiting for Stage 1 completion  
**Status**: ⚪ WAITING  
**Branch**: Will use `arch-review-quality`  
**Dependencies**: Agent 1 Phase 2 completion  
**Next Action**: Monitor REVIEW_STATUS.md for Stage 2 start signal  

**Work Focus**: DRY violations and Technical Debt inventory

---

### **Agent 4 (Integration Agent)**
**Current Task**: Waiting for Stage 1 completion  
**Status**: ⚪ WAITING  
**Branch**: Will use `arch-review-coherence`  
**Dependencies**: Agent 1 Phase 2 completion  
**Next Action**: Monitor REVIEW_STATUS.md for Stage 2 start signal  

**Work Focus**: Architecture consistency and pattern coherence assessment

## 🚦 **Critical Coordination Points**

### **Stage 1 → Stage 2 Transition**
**Trigger**: Agent 1 updates this document with Phase 2 completion  
**Required Update**: Change Stage 2 status from WAITING to IN PROGRESS  
**Agent Actions**: Agents 2-4 can begin their parallel work  

### **Stage 2 → Stage 3 Transition**
**Trigger**: All three agents (2, 3, 4) update this document with phase completion  
**Required Update**: Change Stage 3 status from WAITING to IN PROGRESS  
**Agent Action**: Agent 1 begins consolidation work

## ⚠️ **Coordination Rules**

### **Update Protocol**
1. **Each agent MUST update this document** when completing their assigned phase
2. **Status changes only**: Update your phase status from IN PROGRESS → COMPLETE
3. **Timestamp completion**: Add end time to your phase row in progress table
4. **No cross-agent coordination**: Agents work independently within their phases

### **Stop Points**
- **Agent 1**: STOP after Phase 2 until Agents 2-4 complete
- **Agent 2**: STOP after Phase 3 until all agents complete  
- **Agent 3**: STOP after Phase 4 until all agents complete
- **Agent 4**: STOP after Phase 5 until all agents complete

### **Conflict Resolution**
- **Agent 1 has final architectural authority** for any conflicts or questions
- **Sacred principles from INIT.md** guide all decisions
- **LEDGER.md documented decisions** take precedence over assumptions

## 📋 **Next Actions by Agent**

### **Ready to Begin**
- **Agent 1**: Start Phase 1 Historical Evolution Analysis immediately

### **Waiting for Dependencies**  
- **Agent 2**: Wait for Stage 1 completion signal
- **Agent 3**: Wait for Stage 1 completion signal
- **Agent 4**: Wait for Stage 1 completion signal

### **Final Deliverables Expected**
- **5 Phase Documents**: Complete analysis with file:line references
- **Consolidated Report**: Unified architectural health assessment
- **P0 Readiness Decision**: Go/No-Go with critical path
