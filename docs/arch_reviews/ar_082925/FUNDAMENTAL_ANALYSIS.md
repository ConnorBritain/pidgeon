## ü§ñ **AGENT INSTRUCTIONS - READ FIRST**

**YOU ARE AGENT 2 (Architecture Agent)**  
**Your Role**: Sacred Principles & Single Responsibility analysis on cleaned codebase

### **Your Responsibility**
- **Phase 3**: Sacred Principles Compliance & Single Responsibility Principle Analysis
- **Branch**: `arch-review-fundamentals`
- **Parallel Work**: You work simultaneously with Agents 3 & 4

### **Required Context**
- **REFERENCE**: [`HISTORICAL_EVOLUTION_ANALYSIS.md`](./HISTORICAL_EVOLUTION_ANALYSIS.md) - Understand WHY code exists
- **REFERENCE**: [`CLEANUP_INVENTORY.md`](./CLEANUP_INVENTORY.md) - Know what code to ignore (dead code)
- **DO NOT ANALYZE**: Any code marked for cleanup/removal by Agent 1

### **Critical Dependencies**
- **WAIT**: Do not start until Agent 1 completes Phase 2 and updates [`REVIEW_STATUS.md`](./REVIEW_STATUS.md)
- **FOUNDATION COMPLETE**: Agent 1's cleanup decisions determine what you analyze
- **PARALLEL**: Work simultaneously with Agents 3 & 4, no coordination needed

### **Sacred Principles Authority**
- **Reference**: `docs/roadmap/INIT.md` for sacred architectural principles
- **File-by-file verification**: Complete codesweep required, no spot checks
- **Architectural consistency**: Your findings guide fundamental fixes

### **Critical Stop Point**
- **When you complete this phase**: Update [`REVIEW_STATUS.md`](./REVIEW_STATUS.md) and **STOP ALL WORK**
- **Wait for Agents 1, 3, 4** to signal completion of their respective phases
- **Do not proceed** beyond this analysis until Stage 3 consolidation
