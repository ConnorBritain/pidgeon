## 🏗️ Technical Architecture Validation

### **Current Capabilities vs MVP Requirements**

| MVP Feature | Required Domain | Current State | Gap Analysis |
|------------|----------------|---------------|--------------|
| Message Generation | Clinical → Messaging | ✅ Implemented | Ready |
| Message Validation | Messaging validation | ✅ Parser exists | Need validation rules |
| Vendor Patterns | Configuration domain | ✅ Plugin architecture | Need pattern library |
| Error Debugging | Parser with details | ⚠️ Basic parser | Need error reporting |
| Test Data | Clinical generation | ✅ Implemented | Ready |

### **Architecture Alignment**
