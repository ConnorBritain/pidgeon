## ðŸŽ¯ Core User Stories (P0/P1 Priority)

### INF-001: Troubleshoot Production Message Failures
**As a** healthcare informaticist  
**I want to** quickly diagnose why production messages are failing  
**So that** I can restore interface operations and minimize clinical disruption  

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Parse failed production messages (after PHI removal)
- Identify specific failure points (field, segment, encoding)
- Compare against known good messages
- Suggest fixes based on historical patterns
- Document root cause for knowledge base
- Generate test messages to validate fixes

**Business Value**: Core (basic) + Professional (pattern analysis)  
**Frequency**: Daily during production support  
**Current Pain**: Troubleshooting can take hours, impacting patient care

### INF-002: Monitor Vendor Configuration Changes
**As a** healthcare informaticist  
**I want to** detect when vendor message patterns change unexpectedly  
**So that** I can proactively prevent interface failures from vendor updates  

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Establish baseline vendor configuration from message samples
- Detect deviations from baseline patterns
- Alert on unexpected field usage or format changes
- Track configuration drift over time
- Generate change reports for vendor discussions
- Update test scenarios for new patterns

**Business Value**: Professional - Operational intelligence  
**Frequency**: After vendor upgrades, monthly monitoring  
**Current Pain**: Vendor changes often discovered only after failures

**Current Pain**: Documentation is always out of date with production

---

### INF-005: Validate Interface Changes
**As a** healthcare informaticist  
**I want to** thoroughly test interface changes before production deployment  
**So that** I can ensure changes don't break existing integrations  

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Generate regression test suites from historical messages
- Create edge cases based on production patterns
- Validate against all connected system requirements
- Test error handling scenarios
- Verify backwards compatibility
- Generate test execution reports

**Business Value**: Professional - Quality assurance  
**Frequency**: Before every change deployment  
**Current Pain**: Manual testing misses edge cases, causing production issues
