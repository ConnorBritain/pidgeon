## ðŸŽ¯ Core User Stories (P0 Priority)

### DEV-001: Generate Test Messages Without PHI
**As a** healthcare interface developer  
**I want to** quickly generate valid test messages with realistic data  
**So that** I can test my interface implementations without PHI exposure or manual message crafting  

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Generate any standard HL7v2 message type (ADT, ORM, RDE, ORU)
- Messages contain realistic healthcare data (names, medications, procedures)
- All generated data is synthetic (no PHI risk)
- Messages validate against HL7 standards
- Can generate single messages or batches

**Business Value**: Core (Free) - Drives adoption  
**Frequency**: Multiple times daily  
**Current Pain**: Manually creating test messages takes 15-30 minutes each and often has errors

### DEV-002: Debug Message Parsing Failures
**As a** healthcare interface developer  
**I want to** quickly identify why messages fail to parse  
**So that** I can fix integration issues without manual byte-by-byte analysis  

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Clear error messages showing exact failure location (segment, field, component)
- Visual comparison between expected and actual structure  
- Highlight non-standard characters or encoding issues
- Suggest probable fixes based on common patterns
- Support partial message parsing (show what worked before failure)

**Business Value**: Core (Free) with Professional AI-assist  
**Frequency**: Daily during development/troubleshooting  
**Current Pain**: Finding parsing errors can take hours with current tools

---

### DEV-003: Validate Against Real Vendor Patterns
**As a** healthcare interface developer  
**I want to** validate messages against actual vendor implementations  
**So that** my interfaces work with real systems, not just theoretical standards  

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Choose between strict standard validation and vendor-compatibility mode
- See vendor-specific required/optional fields
- Identify fields that vendor systems ignore or require differently
- Get warnings about known vendor quirks
- Generate messages matching vendor patterns

**Business Value**: Professional - Premium vendor intelligence  
**Frequency**: Throughout integration projects  
**Current Pain**: "Valid" messages still fail with vendor systems

---

### DEV-004: Create Comprehensive Test Suites
**As a** healthcare interface developer  
**I want to** generate comprehensive test scenarios quickly  
**So that** I can ensure my interfaces handle all cases before go-live  

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Generate patient journey scenarios (admission â†’ orders â†’ results â†’ discharge)
- Create edge cases (long names, missing fields, special characters)
- Produce error scenarios (invalid codes, future dates, impossible values)
- Export as reusable test suites
- Include positive and negative test cases

**Business Value**: Professional - Workflow automation  
**Frequency**: Before each release/deployment  
**Current Pain**: Manual test creation misses edge cases found in production

---

### DEV-005: Transform Between Message Standards
**As a** healthcare interface developer  
**I want to** convert messages between HL7v2 and FHIR  
**So that** I can integrate modern and legacy systems without manual mapping  

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- HL7v2 â†’ FHIR transformation preserving clinical meaning
- FHIR â†’ HL7v2 with graceful degradation
- Clear documentation of data loss/transformation decisions
- Maintain referential integrity across resources
- Support custom mapping rules

**Business Value**: Professional - Cross-standard capability  
**Frequency**: Per integration requiring multiple standards  
**Current Pain**: Manual transformation is error-prone and time-consuming

## ðŸ’¡ Workflow Integration

**Typical Developer Workflow**:
1. **Development Phase**: Generate test messages â†’ Validate against standards
2. **Integration Phase**: Detect vendor patterns â†’ Adjust implementation
3. **Testing Phase**: Create test suites â†’ Run validation cycles
4. **Troubleshooting**: Debug failed messages â†’ Apply fixes â†’ Retest
5. **Cross-System**: Transform between standards as needed

**Time Savings**: Current workflow takes 4-6 hours â†’ With Pidgeon: 30-45 minutes
