# Pidgeon Master Roadmap - P0 to P2 Complete Plan
**Version**: 3.0  
**Updated**: September 5, 2025  
**Status**: Consolidated definitive roadmap  
**Source**: Merged from pidgeon_feature_plan.md and feature_roadmap_final.md with complete details preserved

---

## 🎯 **North Star - Testing Suite Product**
**"Realistic scenario testing without the legal/compliance nightmare of using real patient data"**

**Mission**: Transform healthcare integration testing from months-long painful projects to fast, confident interface validation through synthetic data intelligence, vendor pattern recognition, and AI-assisted debugging.

**Success Definition**: Healthcare IT teams generate, validate, and troubleshoot interface scenarios 10x faster while maintaining zero PHI exposure risk.

**Strategic Context**: This roadmap covers **Product 1** of Pidgeon's two-product strategy - the Testing Suite. A separate observability platform will be developed after this testing foundation succeeds.

---

## 🏁 **Foundation Status**
**✅ COMPLETE**: Architectural foundation repair finished (September 2025)
- ✅ Fixed all domain boundary violations (was 21)
- ✅ Resolved critical code duplication (was 600+ lines)
- ✅ Completed all P0-blocking TODOs and FIXMEs
- ✅ **Architectural Health Score**: 100/100

## 🚨 **CRITICAL DATA FOUNDATION GAP IDENTIFIED (September 16, 2025)**
**Status**: 🔴 CLI Lookup Only 40% Effective - Missing Segment Fields Block MVP
- ✅ **Table Foundation**: EXCELLENT (20/20 critical tables complete with rich metadata)
- 🔴 **Segment Field Coverage**: CRITICAL GAP (PID missing 20+ fields, PV1 incomplete)
- 🔴 **Message Lookup**: NOT WORKING (pattern recognition broken despite templates existing)
- 📋 **Template Compliance**: MANDATORY for all data work going forward

### **Immediate P0 Blockers**:
1. **Complete Missing PID Fields**: PID.16 (Marital Status), PID.10 (Race), PID.17 (Religion)
2. **Complete Missing PV1 Fields**: PV1.2 (Patient Class), PV1.4 (Admission Type), PV1.14 (Admit Source)
3. **Fix Message Pattern Recognition**: Enable `pidgeon lookup ADT_A01` functionality
4. **Template Compliance**: ALL data work must use `pidgeon/data/standards/hl7v23/_TEMPLATES/` patterns

**Gate 0.5 Success**: 🔴 **BLOCKED** - Must complete segment fields before proceeding to P1

## 📋 **MANDATORY DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS (September 16, 2025)**

### **🚨 Template Compliance Requirements**
**Status**: MANDATORY for all data work - zero exceptions for consistency

**Template Locations**: `pidgeon/data/standards/hl7v23/_TEMPLATES/`
- **`README.md`**: Design principles and usage patterns
- **`CLEANUP.md`**: Systematic remediation process for existing files
- **`COMPATIBILITY_ANALYSIS.md`**: Lookup system integration verification

**Active Sprint Process**: `docs/DATA_SPRINT.md`
- **Mandatory process**: Systematic template-based data migration
- **Multi-agent coordination**: Clear workflows for parallel development
- **Quality gates**: Zero tolerance for template violations
- **Progress tracking**: Backup file deletion shows completion

**Priority Development Order**: `docs/roadmap/data_integrity/HL7_PRIORITY_ITEMS.md`
- **Foundation First**: Core segments (MSH, PID, PV1) and universal tables (0001, 0002, 0004)
- **MVP Critical Path**: 20-50 rank-ordered items per category for systematic development
- **Interdependency Analysis**: Build dependencies before dependents for clean architecture
- **Success Metrics**: Phase 1 = 60% coverage, Phase 2 = 85% coverage, Phase 3 = 95%+ coverage
- **`segment_template.json`**: Template for all segment definitions
- **`table_template.json`**: Template for all table definitions
- **`datatype_template.json`**: Template for all data type definitions
- **`message_template.json`**: Template for all message structures

**Data Integrity Framework**: `docs/roadmap/data_integrity/`
- **`data_mvp.md`**: 80/20 strategy for data completeness and MVP priorities
- **`HL7_REFERENCE_GUIDE.md`**: Official HL7 v2.3 standards navigation and compliance framework

### **🔄 Data Work Process**
**For ALL data creation or modification:**
1. **MANDATORY**: Read `docs/HL7_LIBRARY_PROCESS.md` for ground truth workflow
2. **MANDATORY**: Research using `node dev-tools/research-hl7-dictionary.js` BEFORE creating
3. **Read Data Integrity Framework**: `data_mvp.md` for priorities, `HL7_REFERENCE_GUIDE.md` for standards
4. **Read Templates First**: `_TEMPLATES/README.md` and `_TEMPLATES/CLEANUP.md`
5. **Use Appropriate Template**: Copy exact template, fill specific values using library research
6. **MANDATORY**: Validate using `node scripts/validate-against-hl7-dictionary.js` AFTER creating
7. **Follow 80/20 Strategy**: Focus on high-impact elements per MVP strategy
8. **Validate Compatibility**: Check against `COMPATIBILITY_ANALYSIS.md`
9. **Test CLI Integration**: Verify lookup functionality works
10. **NO EXCEPTIONS**: Library research + validation + template compliance mandatory

### **📊 Current Template Compliance Status**
- ✅ **Tables**: 20/20 critical tables use rich structure (exceeds template)
- 🔴 **Segments**: Most use placeholder "TODO" data (violates template patterns)
- 🔴 **Messages**: 1/300+ follows template structure
- 🔴 **Data Types**: Some have JSON parsing errors (violates template format)
