# HL7 v2.3 Trigger Event Development Priority Order

**Purpose**: Priority-ordered development plan for HL7 v2.3 trigger events based on clinical event frequency and healthcare workflow criticality.

**Strategy**: Build core patient administration events first, then clinical workflow events, followed by specialized healthcare operations.

**Library Coverage**: L NOT supported by hl7-dictionary - MANDATORY manual research required using official HL7 v2.3 documentation.

**Dependencies**: Requires corresponding message types and segments completed first for each trigger event.

**Documentation Source**: Official HL7 v2.3 standard at https://www.hl7.eu/HL7v2x/v23/std23/hl7.htm

## =¨ **CRITICAL DEPENDENCIES**

### **Message Dependencies (BLOCKING)**
- **CANNOT START** trigger event development without corresponding message types completed
- **A01 event** requires ADT_A01 message structure
- **O01 event** requires ORM_O01 message structure
- **R01 event** requires ORU_R01 message structure
- **All events** require proper trigger event to message type mapping

### **Segment Dependencies (BLOCKING)**
- **A01-A08** require MSH, EVN, PID, PV1 segments
- **O01-O06** require MSH, PID, ORC, OBR segments
- **R01-R04** require MSH, PID, OBR, OBX segments
- **S01-S26** require MSH, SCH, AIG, AIP segments
- **Query events** require MSH, QRD, QRF segments

### **Clinical Workflow Dependencies**
- **Patient events must occur first** before clinical events
- **Order events must occur before** result events
- **Registration events enable** all subsequent patient workflows
- **Query events depend on** existing data in target systems

---

## =Ë **DEVELOPMENT PROCESS**

### **For Each Trigger Event (MANUAL PROCESS)**
1. **VERIFY MESSAGE DEPS**: Ensure corresponding message type completed first
2. **RESEARCH MANUALLY**: Use official HL7 v2.3 documentation at https://www.hl7.eu/HL7v2x/v23/std23/hl7.htm
3. **IDENTIFY SEGMENTS**: Determine required and optional segments for event
4. **CREATE TEMPLATE**: Follow _TEMPLATES/triggerevent_template.json structure
5. **MANUAL VALIDATION**: Verify against HL7 v2.3 specification (no library support)
6. **DELETE BACKUP**: Only after manual verification complete

### **Quality Gates (MANUAL VALIDATION)**
-  **Message dependencies verified** before starting trigger event
-  **Segment requirements documented** from official HL7 specification
-  **Template compliance** verified against _TEMPLATES/triggerevent_template.json
-  **Event definition accuracy** matches official HL7 v2.3 documentation
-  **Clinical workflow context** properly documented

### **Documentation Requirements**

##   **SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS FOR TRIGGER EVENTS**

### **Manual Development Required**
- **No library support** - All research must be done manually using HL7 v2.3 documentation
- **Documentation intensive** - Each event requires careful documentation of clinical context
- **Cross-reference validation** - Must verify event-to-message-to-segment relationships manually
- **Clinical expertise needed** - Understanding healthcare workflows essential for proper implementation

### **Quality Assurance**
- **Peer review recommended** - Have healthcare informatics experts review definitions
- **Clinical validation** - Verify events match real-world healthcare workflows
- **Message correlation** - Ensure trigger events properly align with message structures
- **Segment requirements** - Verify required/optional segments match clinical needs

### **Integration with Other Categories**
- **Trigger events drive message selection** - Each event must map to correct message type
- **Messages define segment requirements** - Segment lists must align with message structures
- **Tables provide coded values** - Events may reference specific table codes
- **Datatypes enable field validation** - Event documentation must specify field types

**Remember**: Trigger events define WHEN healthcare information is exchanged. Perfect accuracy here ensures proper message routing and clinical workflow support.
