# NCPDP XML Workflow Templates and Builders

*Future Implementation - Placeholder*

This directory will contain the workflow orchestration layer for NCPDP XML message generation, following the same hybrid approach established for HL7 v2.3.

## Planned Directory Structure

```

```

## Future Implementation Notes

- Will follow the same hybrid template + builder pattern proven in HL7 v2.3
- Templates for common NCPDP workflows (80% of use cases)
- Builders for complex transaction assembly (20% of use cases)
- Integration with NCPDP validation and XML serialization
- Support for NCPDP transaction types and response handling

## NCPDP Workflow Types

Common NCPDP transaction workflows to support:
- **Claim Submission**: Pharmacy claim processing
- **Eligibility Verification**: Real-time benefits verification
- **Prior Authorization**: Prior auth request/response
- **Reversal**: Transaction reversal processing
- **Rebill**: Claim rebilling workflows

## Architecture Consistency

This structure maintains consistency with:
- HL7 v2.3 and FHIR R4 workflow patterns
- Standard-specific organization
- Scalable directory structure
- Separation of concerns (templates/builders/common)
