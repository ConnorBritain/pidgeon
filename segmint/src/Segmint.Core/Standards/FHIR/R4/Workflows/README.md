# FHIR R4 Workflow Templates and Builders

*Future Implementation - Placeholder*

This directory will contain the workflow orchestration layer for FHIR R4 resource generation, following the same hybrid approach established for HL7 v2.3.

## Planned Directory Structure

```
Workflows/
├── Templates/          # Static factory methods for common FHIR workflows
│   ├── MedicationWorkflows.cs    # Medication-related workflows
│   ├── PatientWorkflows.cs       # Patient resource workflows
│   └── EncounterWorkflows.cs     # Encounter workflows
├── Builders/           # Fluent interface builders for complex scenarios
│   ├── MedicationRequestBuilder.cs    # MedicationRequest builder
│   ├── PatientBuilder.cs              # Patient resource builder
│   └── EncounterBuilder.cs            # Encounter builder
└── Common/             # Shared FHIR workflow utilities
    ├── FhirWorkflowValidation.cs      # FHIR validation utilities
    └── FhirWorkflowExtensions.cs      # Extension methods
```

## Future Implementation Notes

- Will follow the same hybrid template + builder pattern proven in HL7 v2.3
- Templates for common FHIR workflows (80% of use cases)
- Builders for complex resource assembly (20% of use cases)
- Integration with FHIR validation and serialization
- Support for FHIR bundles and complex resource relationships

## Architecture Consistency

This structure maintains consistency with:
- HL7 v2.3 workflow patterns
- Standard-specific organization
- Scalable directory structure
- Separation of concerns (templates/builders/common)
