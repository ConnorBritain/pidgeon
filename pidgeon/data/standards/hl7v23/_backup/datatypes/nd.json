  "dataType": "ND",
  "name": "Numeric Date",
  "description": "The ND data type is used to represent dates in a purely numeric format without separators, providing a compact and standardized way to store date information. It represents dates as consecutive numeric digits (YYYYMMDD) which facilitates efficient storage, transmission, and mathematical date calculations. ND is particularly useful in healthcare systems that require high-performance date processing, legacy system integration, and situations where compact date representation is essential for system efficiency.",
