  "description": "The CQ data type is used to specify a quantity along with its units of measure. It provides a structured way to represent measurements, dosages, durations, and other quantified values commonly used in healthcare. This data type ensures that numeric values are always accompanied by their appropriate units, preventing ambiguity in clinical and administrative data exchange.",
