  "description": "The MA data type is used to represent waveform data or continuous measurements as multiplexed arrays. It supports the transmission of digital samples from medical devices such as ECG machines, monitors, and other diagnostic equipment. MA provides a structured way to encode time-series data with multiple channels, sample rates, and measurement units, commonly used for physiological signals and continuous monitoring data.",
