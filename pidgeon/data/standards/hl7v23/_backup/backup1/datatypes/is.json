  "description": "The IS data type is used for coded values that are defined by site-specific or user-defined tables rather than HL7-defined tables. It follows the formatting rules for ST fields but draws values from institution-specific tables. This allows healthcare organizations to define their own coded values for fields where standardization across all institutions isn't practical.",
