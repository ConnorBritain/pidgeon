  "description": "The following trigger event is served by QRY (a query from another system) and ADR (a response from an Patient Administration system.) \nAnother application determines a need for Patient Administration data about a patient and sends a query to the Patient Administration system. The Who Filter in the QRD can identify the patient or account number upon which the query is defined and can contain a format code of “R” (record-oriented). If the query is based on the Patient ID and there are data associated with multiple accounts, the problem of which account data should be returned becomes an implementation issue. The ADT event-type segment, if included in the response, describes the last event for which the Patient Administration system initiated an unsolicited update",
